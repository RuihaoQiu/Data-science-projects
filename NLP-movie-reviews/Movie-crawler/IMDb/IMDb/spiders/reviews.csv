It started off fantastic...,"No one, not even Matt Groening himself, could've imagined that The Simpsons would become as big as it did. Nor could anyone anticipate it could become so cultural. ""D'oh"" is in the dictionary, and it has spawned off several catch-phrases and one liners. Truly, The Simpsons is the biggest thing since Seinfeld! The first three seasons showed them as if they were an actual family. Like the kind of family you'd meet on the street (only a lot more dysfunctional). Homer trying to do the fatherly thing in each episode. Marge being the voice of reason all the time. Lisa and Bart with their sibling rivalry. These first three seasons are not usually sighted as being the best, but they are often brought up when one speaks of ""The Best Episode Ever!"" By Season four, the show took a turn for what may have been the best. It left it's more realistic roots and became more of a satire. With more zany antics and more clever, witty, and often times sophisticated humor, The Simpsons became the most popular family on television. Each episode still contained it's own merits, themes and messages. Seasons 4 to about 10 are often said to be the ""Golden Age"" of The Simpsons.,However, as the year 2000 came, fans began to see themselves divided. Those who stuck with the show since it came about in 1989 were quick to jump on how the show changed. The humor became more lurid and toilet like, with antics becoming heavily more unrealistic and zany (to the point where some even say it isn't funny... but stupid). Some characters becoming unrealistically stupid, and the show shifting gears from focusing on Bart to Homer... to everyone outside of the Simpson family. The show also began to see more cumbersome and meaningless plots. Plots that didn't focus on current issues, or that didn't seem to be as strong as older episodes. Despite this, new fans seem to have come about to replace then, and the show continues to remain at the top of its game, even today.,I'm sure you all know where I stand on that debate. Nine stars to nine fantastic seasons.",The Simpsons,9
This Show Will Be Used to Study How Life Was 100 Years From Now,"Brilliant television series that could probably be best described as ""The Flintstones"" gone stark-raving mad. ""The Simpsons"", everyone knows them. Some love the series and some could care less about it. Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. The titled animated family makes their home in Springfield, USA and gets into situations that are seemingly more outlandish and crazier than the previous adventure. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are still going strong after nearly a dozen years of television life and with each passing moment it seems that the series sets some new precedent. For several years the show seemed to be the only attraction to the then obscure Fox Network. It was the first primetime animated show that was treated like a sitcom since ""The Flintstones"" quietly left the air in 1966. Many people feared the series when it first premiered in 1989 because they felt that it was hardcore adult material in a candied form that would appeal to younger audiences. Well for the most part this was true. However, ""The Simpsons"" would prove to be much more for all audiences. The great thing about the series is that it caters to all audiences. True there are usually situations that may not be suitable for all viewers, but then again that is true with everything on television this side of Disney Land and Sesame Street. ""The Simpsons"" works because of great comedy of course, but also great lessons that can be taken from most of the episodes. The people within the program may be animated, but they are just as complicated and vulnerable as the people watching them. All the regulars have their quirks, but in some episodes you can understand what certain characters are going through because the show is so life-like at times. Former President George Bush (the one from 1988-1992) once made a statement that families should be more like ""The Waltons"" and less like ""The Simpsons"". His opinion is somewhat old-fashioned and unrealistic. In other words, many topics dealt with in ""The Simpsons"" fit life for people in the 1990s and 2000s better than ""The Waltons"" did in the 1970s. A crowning achievement in television art. 5 stars out of 5.",The Simpsons,
The greatest television show of all time,"What more can I possibly say about a TV show that has already been praised to death?  I was 15 when the Simpsons first aired and I'm 25 now.  I've seen every single episode, and I'd have to say it's a rare combination of factors that come together to make The Simpsons the best show ever.,It's a very clever and intelligent show - they never dumb anything down - and as creator Matt Groening has remarked, ""The Simpsons is a show that rewards paying attention.""  There are always enough obscure pop-culture references or subtle background gags to ensure that the second, third, or tenth viewing of an episode will find you noticing something you hadn't before.,In the early days of The Simpsons, they derived a large part of their popularity from the everyday, down-to-earth, unglamorous, average-blue-collar-slob aspect of the Simpson family.  Homer is lazy and doesn't like his job, Bart doesn't excel at school, the plastic ketchup bottle they use at the dinner table makes that farting sound, and so on. This aspect of the program contrasts it with popular 80's family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show which always featured impossibly well-functioning families who got along a little too perfectly and usually learned a neat little lesson at the end of each episode.  An early tag-line for The Simpsons said that they ""put the Fun back in Dysfunctional."",Perhaps this blue-collar-slobness by itself is nothing shockingly original - think of previous TV shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children, All in the Family, The Honeymooners - but the Simpsons doesn't stop there.  This show is extremely densely packed with jokes - everything from cerebral witticisms and sly satire to Homer falling down and going ""D'oh!""  Because it's a cartoon, the writers can get away with surreal gags such as the time Homer tells a joke which falls flat, after which a long silence happens which is punctuated by a single tumbleweed rolling through the Simpson's living room.,There are just too many things to mention about The Simpsons.  It can be touching occasionally; more often the viewers are treated to an unequalled cavalcade of obscure references, surreal sight gags, wacky adventures, self-mocking irony...   The list goes on and on.  Just watch it, else you're missing out on one of the most important elements of 1990's popular culture.",The Simpsons,
Probably the best television show on Earth,"The Simpsons is the longest running animated TV series since The Flinstones, and you could understand why after watching just one of the Simpsons episodes. Simply because The Simpsons is just so hilarious and incredibly clever and has been ripped off so many times, but nothing has come close to the brilliance that the Simpsons writers have brought us.,We have Homer Simpson, one of the most beloved TV characters of all time, with his famous quote ""Doh!"". He's an overweight, lazy, and not the brightest bulb, but so incredibly lovable for the fact of how bipolar he is! One minute he can be so incredibly depressed, but the next minute really happy and giggling. My favorite Homer quote is when he kills the zombie Ned Flanders in a Halloween episode, Bart tells him ""Dad! You killed the zombie Flanders!""... ""He was a zombie?"" Marge is Homer's wife and a homemaker. She is at times naggy, but always manages to get in some terrific humor and some deep sympathy with all she puts up with. My favorite Marge quote is ""Bart, don't make fun of grad students. They've just made a terrible life choice."" Bart is the oldest son and a rebel. His usual quotes are ""Don't have a cow"" ""Cool, man!"" ""Ei Carumba!"". He's this generation's Dennis the Menace. My favorite Bart quote is ""I need a soul, Ralph, any, your's!"", you'll see what I mean.,Lisa is the second oldest and the smartie pants of the Simpson clan, she's kind of the know it all who solves all the adventures of the Simpsons. My favorite Lisa quote is ""They're only using you for your pool you know... shut up brain! I have friends now, I don't need you any more!"". Last, but not least, Maggie, the eternal baby of Homer and Marge, always a great love of the screen, but no famous quotes, just memorable moments like when she turns into an alien.,The supporting cast is a terrific addition, my favorites include Mr. Burns, Homer's boss, Groundskeeper Willy, the school janitor, and Mr. Skinner, the school principal. The Simpson is just a terrific show that in one way or another you will see at least one episode in your lifetime. I know that generations to come, they will still be watching The Simpsons.",The Simpsons,
May be suffering a bit with time  but overall this is one of the finest show to come out of America,"The series that follows the dysfunctional family of the Simpsons.  The oafish Homer who can barely go a day without slacking or getting mixed up in crazy adventures. His wife, Marge, who tries to hold it all together.  His duaghter Lisa who is smarter that her gene pool should allow, Bart  every inch the classroom rebel.  The family is rounded out by the youngest  baby Maggie.  The family interact with those around them and learn lessons or sometimes fail to change completely.,When this series started in 1987 as a string of rough shorts in Tracey Ulman's show it would be a brave man who would have predicted that over a decade later that this series would be as huge as it is.  However the series got launched with the Christmas special in the early 90's.  The first series saw the animation greatly improved and the characters developed fully to be more involving.  However the story lines were not as sharp or as full as they were to be.  The second series and onwards saw the Simpsons have better stories  often multi-layered stories filled with pop-culture references and background jokes that reward the careful viewerto try and list them would take ages.,For an American sitcom (for that is what it is) this is amazing  the intelligence of the script is fantastic.  The depth of the stories are involving, witty and packed.  For a movie buff like me, this is a gold mine  from sly references in the background to full blow scenes almost spoofing movies this has them all. In some programmes that have background jokes the main stuff at the front often suffers or is ignored totally.  However here the main plot and dialogue is fresh and well thought out  it is amazing that for almost all of it's run The Simpsons rarely had a bad episode.,True  recent shows have begun to show a slide in quality but this is to be expected after more than 10 years at the top.  However it is generally brilliant and clever.  After the first series everything improved.  Not only was the series used for political comment, satire and ironic humour (in a country that generally can't do any well) but it is also heart warming and funny.,The characters live in a balance between reality and surreality.  They are sort of recognisable as real people in terms of habits and experiences  but in another way they are out there..Homer has been in Space, stopped a nuclear explosion etc.  The mix of this makes for an unique programme.  What makes it better is that the makers never draw a line between the madness and the normality  one episode is made up of a bad-neighbour type war between Homer and George Bush Snr!  The mix is seamless and adds layers to each show.,The wealth of characters is another strength. The main family is strong  even Maggie has regular input and adventures!  However where most sitcoms really rely on their main subjects for the stories, The Simpsons has a supporting cast of dozens and dozens of really good characters  all of whom are able to carry an episode.  They range from the normal characters (an inept  Police Chief, an Asian shop keeper who is used to being robbed at gunpoint) to the referential or well imagined, (the well-educated Sideshow Mel, a bitter Krusty the Clown, an useless lawyer).  All the characters have become more fully used as time has gone on.,The voice actors are all excellent and all do a huge range of voicesof course they get very well paid for it!  Unfortunately the late Phil Hartman provided the voices of two of my favourite characters and I really miss his dry humour and strong all-American voice.  Lionel Hutz was a great character and my favourite, Troy McClure is a wonderful spoof of 60's B-movie actor Doug McClure.  This depth really helps the show and has allowed it to feel so very fresh years on.,I could go on for ever, but the series is a wonderful bit of proof that sitcoms don't have to be simple, full of canned laughter and focus on sassy teenagers!  The joys of the dialogue are backed up by movie references and crazy adventures.  The wonderful Simpson family are supported by a huge cast of imaginative characters who are always well used and a queue of celebrities just lining up to have a few minutes in the show. Quite simply this is consistently the best show to come out of American in my life time.",The Simpsons,
A landmark in TV-show history,"i have yet to see something as funny, clever and entertaining as ""The Simpsons"" on TV. I'm hardly a TV-series buff, I rarely have the patience and interest to follow a show for more than five or six episodes. ""The Simpsons"" is the one show that I am very sorry to have missed out on until just a couple of years ago. Luckily, Swedish television are rerun experts. It is also the only show that I make sure to follow apart from perhaps ""Friends"", but in entertainment value, ""The Simpsons"" is way ahead.,What makes this show so great is its attention to detail, its outrageous dialogue and its completely fearless way of dealing with any issue that crosses the writers' minds. The many characters and their extravaganza makes it an endless well of new angles, new ideas and even more outrageous dialogues. Another very important element is the mocking irony and sarcasm which permeates the entire series. The smarmy and cheesy moments that a great many episodes end up in are extremely clever and becomes an important part of the fun.,What impresses me the most about the series is, however, the enormous amount of detail: the attentive spectator is not just in for the obvious gags - there's always something going on or something to read in the background, which makes a VCR mandatory so you can go back and check that special detail out again. Its a fantastic show, and its a great moment when one can sit down and watch another insane, stupid, disastrous and hilarious episode.",The Simpsons,
Pure genius,"The Simpsons is a show that has sustained ten years of constant humor.  The stories have gradually become better and the second fiddle characters were getting more screen time which translates into a much more realized show. The pop culture references abound and delight those who can pick them out. My personal favorite is the Citizen Kane references in the episode called ""Rosebud.""  Plus, anything with C. Montgomery Burns is hysterical.  The guest stars aren't there as a ""special appearance"" touted by the networks. They actually work into the storyline, and that makes it all the more enjoyable.  Where else can you see The Moody Blues acting like thugs in a Vegas casino?",The Simpsons,
Talk about being a mere shadow of its former self......,"The Simpsons, back in the early to mid 90's, was by far the greatest sitcom ever on TV. With strong jokes, humorous parodies, funny slapstick and wonderful plots it swept the nation by storm. For those who don't know, the Simpsons is about an American family called the Simpsons (hence the title) who live in the fictional town of Springfield. The father, Homer, is a beer bellied not so smart guy who works in the local nuclear power plant. His wife, Marge is a doting housewife and mother, and they have three kids, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. This show, back over a decade ago, stood out for two reasons. One, it was an animated sitcom (which was based mostly on reality, fantasy elements shown in typical cartoons appeared briefly) and two, the Simpsons was a dysfunctional family, except the volume was turned way up. Back in the 90's sitcoms involved families who were a strong unit and cared for each other and all that stuff, but the Simpsons were constantly having problems and such, always getting back together in the end, which was the theme of the show and what kept it on top. The prime of the show would be, in my opinion, around 1993-1997 (or the third through the sixth season,) After that, the show began to lose humorous edge, and by the early 2000 period, the show really began to fall apart. It is now 2006, and with even worse episodes being churned out, the show probably should of called it quits by 97 or 98 when it showed signs of age.,So what happened? The show is clearly different now then it was ten years ago but there seems to be a lot of little things that made the show go south. I noticed by the 11 or 12th season, the show started to include very ridiculous and crazy plots that would never happen in real life (and every celebrity on the planet would start to appear in every episode, one by one) Now before anybody flames me and says ""It's a cartoon dumbass!"" (I couldn't figure that out, thanks guys!) It is important to understand that in the prime of the show it had plots that were realistic, things that normal people could go through every day (Maybe it would go outside the barriers of reality, but only briefly) You could relate to the characters, and actually cared what happened to them. By the way, celebrates did appear in the past, but they were usually cameos or voiced characters, rather then playing themselves like now. But now that the plots and ideas are so nuts that I don't really care what the resolution will turn out to be. And now the celebrity guest will have a whole episode involving him, which really makes the show boring in my opinion. Another problem with the show is that the jokes simply aren't as funny or interesting anymore, and that is what really is hurting the show. The writers try hard to be funny, but fail miserably. But I believe the number one problem is the new personalities of the characters.,Homer, back in the prime of the sitcom, was at times a big jerk who sometimes did things to advantage himself and hurt others, but in the end, he always did the right thing at the conclusion and he was a good guy overall. And although he wasn't a very bright man (His stupidity is one of the highlights of the show) He only had moments when he was a complete dumbass. But now the writers dummed down homer to look like a total retard, he has also evolved to be an unbearable jackass with no redeeming qualities whatsoever (and it seems like now he is spending every minute of every episode doing something incredibly stupid beyond sanity.) Bart used to be a mischievous kid who did get into trouble on occasion, but always knew his limits and acted like a typical ten year old kid. Now, he's more of a whiny brat who tries really hard to be a tough criminal. He also tries to act tough by bullying his nerdy friend Milhouse, whom in earlier seasons, had a good friendship with Bart and he saw Milhouse as an equal and not his flunkie like today. Lisa was a very smart eight year old who had strong beliefs over issues but really tried to live a normal life as an eight year old, but now is a intolerant PC hippie who believes her views are superior to anyone elses. And Marge, well, shes still the housewife, but she seems to care less nowadays and will sometimes try way to hard to be ""cool"" and ""hip"" but always failing to be funny. Maggie is the one who changed the least, but shes only one year old, so you can't expect much. The side characters (Moe, Mr. Flanders, etc) also seemed to change as well, though for the worse.,Finally, the Simpsons was the greatest sitcom back in the heyday, but now is crumbling like a wall. I stopped watching the show a few years ago because I just couldn't take the declining quality anymore. The bad plots, poor jokes and repackaged personalities of the characters are beginning to cause the show's decay. I won't dismiss the show's past accomplishments, but the new episodes are downright unbearable. I recommend the show, but get the seasons three to six, you'll laugh out loud. The first two seasons are good, but didn't get that edge just yet. Anything later then 1997 I wouldn't watch, but like a wise man said, ""Opinions are like assholes, everybody has one"" So see it for yourself and make up your own judgment.",The Simpsons,
This may be the best show on Television.,"This is definitely the best ANIMATED show on television. I have been a Simpsons fan for a long time, and over the years it has been going downhill, but recently its been really funny! I think that this is best for people who LOVE SEEING GREAT COMEDY AT WORK! Matt Groening is one of the funniest TV people ever (though I should be fair, a lot of the Simpsons is the writers, if not most of it). For those who don't know, it's about a dysfunctional family living in a town called Springfield (the state is unknown!!!!). There's Homer, the dimwitted father working at the Nuclear Powerplant. Then there's Marge, the housewife who is the classic mom. There's Bart, the spiky haired hell-raiser who has a knack for getting in trouble. There's Lisa, the intellectual middle child who plays the Saxaphone and is the smartest one in the family. Then finally there's Maggie, the baby that only talks in sucks on her pacifier. All in all, each episode includes their many misadventures including a meteor hitting the earth, and Homer causing Y2K. Bottom line, totally funny!",The Simpsons,10
It doesn't try to be anything that it isn't. And that's kinda the point.,"You're going to see a lot of reviews on here say that it's predictable, silly, probably a few other criticisms that are perfectly fair. But this movie knows what it is, and the authenticity makes it enjoyable. It has a genuinely sweet romance, great comedic moments, and good messages. It's a silly romcom with a lot of charm and heart, and it's worth a couple hours of your time. Give it a chance.",I Feel Pretty,8
"Once Great, Now Ridiculous","For the first 8 seasons or so that it was on the air, ""The Simpsons"" was one of the greatest television shows of all time. Wonderfully developed characters, biting satire and top-notch writing made this cartoon a joy to watch. However, the show began to slide in season nine, and while it remained watchable through season ten or so, it has now become a shell of its former self. From about season 13 on, this formerly awesome show became the kind of ""entertainment"" it once parodied so well.,Several factors have contributed to the sorry drop in quality of the show. First, Homer's character has changed. He used to be a bumbling idiot, but had some good qualities. He has now morphed into a super-annoying, always in-your-face kind of moron. There is nothing likable about the new Homer. As for the other characters, Marge has become as morally bankrupt as Homer and is not likable either. Lisa, always a weak character, is now a little spokesperson for the Democratic Party. She spews out more propaganda than the ""Weekend Update"" no-talents on SNL. An eight-year old Buddhist? Come on! Bart has become less of a creative troublemaker, and is now more of a wimpy sidekick to Homer. The killing of Maude Flanders was inexcusable, and characters like Milhouse and Moe have become sometimes frighteningly weird (references to Milhouse-a ten year old boy-being gay and/or a cross dresser, for instance). Apu having all those kids was absurd. The shows now revolve around ""wild and crazy"" plots, with Homer constantly in the forefront. There is the constant, unnecessary use of blood and gore (Homer seems to always be cutting off something, and we are supposed to think it's funny). Also, the gratuitous use of guest stars is sickening. They are never funny, and serve only to promote and glorify themselves. ""The Simpsons"" used to poke fun at these pretentious celebrities. If this show stays on the air just a few more years, there will be more bad shows in syndication than good ones.,The DVD season-by-season sets are great, and really serve to remind us of how far this once incredible show has fallen. I'd advise everyone to buy these boxed sets and remember the great writing, inventive plots and brilliant characterizations that flourished during the first 8 seasons of the greatest cartoon series in history.",The Simpsons,4
The Simpsons rules!!! (episode spoilers),"The Simpsons, a town that was created from the humorous mind of Matt Groening in 1989, has now become a cult classic after an amazing 17 seasons, and it continues in fact they are making a film of the Simpson's due out in 2007. the Simpson's have been through a lot in their town, 17 tree houses of horror, the highest grossing episode ever, (bart gets an f) and 360 other mishaps which always seem to include famous voices, I don't care Futurama is nowhere near as good as this gem of a creation more laughs more characters and generally an all round good egg that is why I have decided to give this series a good solid 10 out of 10 because even after 378 episodes i find myself watching every last one over and over and over no matter how many times i see them",The Simpsons,8
Lost it's touch years ago,"I'd give a higher rating, but The Simpsons's died long time ago and should have ended when it had some dignity left. Now every episode seems like the same.,That said The Simpsons was solid stuff years ago. It was funny, touching and thought provoking. Best episode that comes to mind must be Bart gets an F (I hope that is the real name or this is really embarrassing).",The Simpsons,7
What The Hell?,"Surprised to see how low the rating is for this movie. I went to see this movie when I felt like giving up on life in the hope that it would help me feel better and it did.

the absolute Best Cartoon ever!,"Out of every cartoon, Movie, play, and T.v show I've ever seen The Simpsons tops it all. the Simpsons is the funniest show Bar None. American Dad, Futurama, and Family guy come in close but in my opinion the Simpsons is better than all of them combined. I have seen every single episode and i own seasons one through five and have Simpsons posters and action figures.i have not found an episode that i did not like., some of my favorites are the valentines episode where Bart puts Homers Beer in the paint shakers, and ""Das Bus"" season 9 ""O' Brother were art Thou?"" season 2. and any episode from the sixteenth season. they have made it to over three hundred episodes and I'm betting on three hundred more. THE SIMPSONS WILL NEVER DIE!",The Simpsons,
Two Ends Of The Scale In One Show,"I think I know exactly what the majority of the people reading this interview are saying- ""5/10?? What the hell is going on here?! Has this guy lost his mind???!!"" I admit, it was quite a difficult rating to give, and not one that I imagine will go down particularly well. But the unfortunate fact about this review is that I can't just look at the show's ""Golden Age"" when it was widely considered to be one of the funniest television shows ever created, cartoon or otherwise. Nor can I talk about the almost inconceivable plummet in the show's standards over the past five or so years, though God knows I could talk about that for hours. I have to look at the whole series, from the very beginning to where we are now, and take the whole of The Simpsons into account, from the ingenious hilarity of the past to the staggeringly awful quality we have today.,First off, I should make it abundantly clear that to me, The Simpsons, from season one right up until season ten, was one of the funniest television shows ever to air, past, present and I strongly believe future. Creator Matt Groening, together with Sam Simon and James L. Brooks, should be very proud of the work they achieved with them. These seasons are simply incredibly, painfully, blood vessel-burstingly hilarious. Blessed with an incredibly talented and naturally comedic cast, nearly all of whom have stayed committed to the show since its beginning, it has been host to a huge amount of characters who are all brilliantly funny in their own unique, very original way. The jokes range from silly slapstick, all the way through to sharply satirical, and everything in between, and they are nothing short of fantastic. The sheer amount of hilarious quotes and one-liners The Simpsons has in these seasons is nearly unfathomable, and it's not mystery as to why people all over the world can quote them so easily. Truly, they have set the bar for not only television comedy, but comedy on a whole.,As well as this though, it never lost sight of the three-dimension of its characters. What makes it great is that we feel for all of them, and watching it, it never feels as though we're watching a cartoon comedy, because it engrosses us in the stories of the people in it, and because there really is so much depth to the characters and the stories that concern them as well as excellent comedy that they almost feel like real people. This of course is especially in the case of the Simpson family themselves, all of whom are excellent characters in these seasons, who have real emotional reactions and feelings, which makes their short-comings all the more relatable. The ability of the cast to convey these emotions as well as the comedy is remarkable, and has led to some truly touching and poignant moments over the seasons.,Once we move past the end of the tenth season, there is a definite drop in the quality of the show, though not a drastic one. The jokes are a little less funny, the characters somewhat wasted, and the stories aren't quite as intelligent and enjoyable as they used to be, however it is still excellent television and extremely funny. The cast are still as inspired as they always were, and despite the tragic loss of Phil Hartman by this time, which saw the loss of two excellent characters Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz among others, they are still displaying immense talent and understanding of an astronomical amount of characters.,Now, we come to the problem. The reason for the 5/10 rating. A truly heart-breaking moment in television history, because once we reach the fifteenth season, we see the standard of The Simpsons has dived. And it has dived pretty deeply. From this point of the show to where it is today, it's as if we are seeing a different show. The stories are moronic, the jokes are cringingly awful, exchanging intelligence and wit for silliness and humourless exclamations, and the characters are mutilated. The fact the animation has improved only emphasises the change, and all the guest-stars and guest writers in the world can't salvage this shipwreck.,The awful jokes and lack of good stories are bad enough, but the worst problem with The Simpsons today, is that the characters have been ruined. All of them were once three-dimensional, interesting and real, but they are all now nothing but background pictures, opportunities for jokes. And bad ones at that. My answer to the question that everyone asks about The Simpsons is my favourite character (other than Homer) is Sideshow Bob, but even one as hilarious as him can't seem to manage one good joke. The worst offence is of course ruining the Simpsons themselves. It started early on with Marge, who was given terrible jokes and pointless stories, and now has even spread to Maggie, who is also stuck with uninteresting, unfunny stories.,I don't fully understand how people can stop being funny. It doesn't sound like something that can just happen, but that is exactly what has happened to the writers of The Simpsons. The show that was once ground-breaking and ingenious is now pathetic, a tired old dog limping to the grave that it should have reached years ago. I may sound bitter, and in truth I am, because this was a truly spectacular, one-of-a-kind show, and now it will not be allowed to be put to rest. I love the Simpsons. I love the characters, I love the cast's performances and I love the stories. But that was quite a long time ago, when it deserved it. When it does eventually end, I will of course be extremely sad, but I will be more relieved that finally this great television programme can call it a day at last.",The Simpsons,5

GREAT COMEDIC MOVIE!!,I have no idea why people are commenting negatively on this movie!! I went to see this movie with my mom and my friend and we were dying the whole time!

Excellent,"The Simpsons is one of the best TV shows of all times. It is a perfect mirror of the American culture and has many memorable moments that will always be remembered . I don't know anybody who doesn't like this show, it's impossible not to be a fan of it. You could watch each episode 20 times and never get tired, you will always find a new funny thing every time you watch it,Unfotunatley the show is getting worse and worse with every new season, Maybe it's time to let ""The Simpsons"" die with dignity before the audience starts to hate it.,My rating: 11/10",The Simpsons,
"Brilliant TV show, but newer episodes aren't funny","I really love The Simpsons, the 90's episodes are the best. I really liked it going up to season 13 but it started going downhill. But it really started going downhill after its 20th anniversary. ,The early episodes are excellent. There's no doubt about it. Some of the best episodes include Lisa's First Word, A Streetcar Named Marge, Hurricane Neddy, Homer's Odyssey and of course the episodes with Sideshow Bob in them. They had lots of laughs, were very entertaining and if you had a bad day, they would lighten you up.,After the tenth season, the quality started to decline. Although an episode originally aired in 2001, New Kids on the Blecch, I really enjoyed. Other episodes in seasons 11-13 I liked as well. But episodes in seasons 14-19 weren't as great. ,After its 20th anniversary, the series declined immensely. They had guest stars like Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga. Why!? The episodes from seasons 20 on aren't funny at all. The animation improved, that's the only thing good about it. I think it's time to wrap up the series altogether. It should have stopped after its 13th or 14th season.,I don't like the newer episodes at all, but I love the 90's episodes and the episodes in the very early 2000's. I love The Simpsons truly so I'm going to give it a 10/10.",The Simpsons,10
Great movie!,"I seriously don't get the horrible reviews on this movie! People are constantly hating on Amy and sometimes I feel like they have nothing better to do. I really enjoyed this movie! I thought it had such a good story line and it really spoke to me. I, as with many women, struggle with self esteem and this movie couldn't have shown a better representation of what it's like being on the average or less then average spectrum. It truly was an empowering movie for women and I respect Amy for playing this role. There wasn't a single quiet moment in the theatre tonight. Everyone was laughing!",I Feel Pretty,10
LOVE THIS MOVIE!,Great movie! I absolutely love anything Amy Schumer does! The movie is funny and heart warming! All of the negative reviews are just coming from people who get off on hating good comedy. Amy does nt deserve the hate. She is great!,I Feel Pretty,10
"Honest to god, is this what ""comedy"" has come to?","I saw a free screening and somehow still wanted my money back. This kind of self-indulgent crap is why people don't trust Hollywood comedies anymore. Not only is the cheesy message of this movie dishonest and singular to only one demographic of people, but it's a fairly obvious retread of Shallow Hal with a few key details changed. ,Replace Amy Schumer with literally anyone and it would be a little funnier, but not a whole lot, since the writing is so mediocre and predictable. ""Oh, it's what's on the INSIDE that counts! How did I not see it before?"" is the movie's realization, a message that had been beaten into the audience's head with a sledgehammer from minute one of the movie, but somehow it took this dense, unlikable, cringe-inducing protagonist an hour and a half of screen time to figure out. I laughed literally once during this film, when Schumer's character got her hair stuck in the stationary bike, which of course, is shown in the trailer. Was I laughing at the idea of Amy Schumer in pain, you ask? Possibly. Doesn't matter. Still counts as one laugh.,Just skip it. Go see Super Troopers 2 instead and support people that actually have some talent and couldn't get their movie funded by a production company, (which leaves me to wonder how this utter abortion of a film did). ST2 isn't groundbreaking, but at least I didn't leave it wanting my money back.",I Feel Pretty,1
Heads and Tails,"This show requires two reviews. On one side (season 1-9), we have a show that ranges from good to brilliant and, on the other (season 10+), we have a show that ranges from mediocre to absolutely atrocious.,Most of what went wrong has been stated by pretty much everyone who once loved The Simpsons. Today, it is nothing like what it started out as. It's now just a big dumb cartoon for big dumb people. The soul has been ripped out and replaced by a putrid cesspool. The only drive there is at all now—be it for the writers or for the voice actors—is MONEY. The Simpsons has a multitude of writers (many of them now long gone), so it's little wonder that it has such extremes in quality. Clearly, no-one in charge cares about the show anymore; if they did, it would have ended a long time ago. But let's not blame the cast and crew entirely, because DUMB people are still watching this drivel. Either that or stupidly 'loyal' fanboys being taken for a ride. Still, there is no doubt that, somewhere along the way, a decision was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator, thus targeting a wider demographic, instead of those with a higher intellect. It's tougher to write clever, heart-felt stories than to write childish, directionless crap. That's where we are today.,I differ with most people as to when the Simpsons started heading down hill. To me, it was season four. Season four is the first major departure from self contained, logically sound storytelling in favour of mindless slapstick (especially in regards to Homer's transformation from loving dad to crazy moron). Go and watch seasons one to three, and you'll notice that season four is where the main departure took place (although there are some warning signs of what is to come in seasons two and three, such as celebrity appearances and the odd episode with Homer acting like an idiot). I consider seasons one to three to have a 10/10 rating, and seasons four to nine to have an 8/10 rating. The difference to me is that in seasons one to three, the characters act and feel real. The situations are mostly realistic, people are behaving like people, and there is an emotional attachment to the characters. I still enjoy seasons four to nine but, in my opinion, they were heading in the wrong direction. ,After season nine, the show deteriorates before collapsing entirely. Here are some of the reasons:,1. Stories are now predominantly based on slapstick. Suspension of disbelief is impossible to maintain.,2. There is no structure to the stories. Episodes have become a vehicle for cheap jokes and predictable set-pieces. The audience is bombarded with them. Stories are no longer about anything—there is no message.,3. Pathetic celebrity appearances that are nothing more than an annoying ego-boosting exercise for those involved. The fact this hasn't abated, despite how obviously BAD it is, tells me a great deal about the people who now run The Simpsons.,4. Characters behaving totally abnormally and increasingly ridiculous. This is most noticeable with Homer, but occurs across the board. For example, Lisa is now a mouthpiece for the Left, and Chief Wiggum is the most ridiculous cop on earth.,5. Humour is no longer clever or based around a story; it's all just lame and chaotic.,6. All flash and no substance. Even the perfect intro has been replaced with a bloated monstrosity that illustrates perfectly where the problems lie: Flash and no substance, quantity and not quality, clean and lifeless animation (also less unique frames).,7. No direction or goal. Most ideas have already been realized.,8. Stories are no longer character driven.,It's disheartening to know that when The Simpsons finally ends, it will bring with it a huge sigh of relief, rather than sadness. Who would have thought that would be the case in the early '90s?",The Simpsons,1
No longer that great,"When the animated TV series ""The Simpsons"" first came out, nobody could image how successful it would become. But they made this a clever TV series: that original family with their silly humor conquered many people. From 1989 until (maybe) almost the end of the 1990's, this was a great TV show. It was very humorous, highly creative and had all the needed ingredients to be a classic.,All of the characters are very peculiar and eccentric: Bart, Lisa, Marge and Homer. On the other hand, Maggie is innocent because she's a baby. Marge has that weird hair and Homer is more than just the silliest of all Simpsons: he's the silliest ""family chief"" ever!,However, in these last years ""The Simpsons"" has been notoriously going downhill. It isn't that great anymore. It doesn't have that classic status any longer and its humor has become more irritating. It isn't so funny anymore.,Now is definitely time to put an end to this TV show. They should have done that years ago. The more time they'll take to finally do it, the more they'll ruin it.",The Simpsons,
Amazing!,Thank you for this movie!!! It was excellent - helping women realize that their bodies are beautiful the way they are!,I Feel Pretty,10
Aren't there writers in Hollywood anymore?,"I just couldn't believe it. They are kind of remaking Shallow Hal, Shallow Hal !
Is there a drought in Hollywood? No writers? If this gets the go ahead from a corporation who's in the business of making money, I don't know what they're doing because this is not going to make money and it certainly won't break barriers, or tell us something new. Where are the writers of Barbershop (2002) or The Ref or Death Becomes Her, three examples of very smart & very funny. I Feel Pretty has one saving grace, Michelle Williams. She is completely there for us that's why a 2 and not a 1 - Do I sound pedantic? I'm sorry, I really am.",I Feel Pretty,2
Don't listen to the haters- this is a piece of movie magic,"Amy Schumer delivers a smart, heart-warming, and absolutely hilarious piece of comedy in her new movie ""I Feel Pretty."" She is raw and real, and that's what I love about this actress. Her newest movie is probably my favourite of hers as I relate to it so much as a woman- it's so important to love yourself for who you are! I brought my boyfriend to see the film and he loved it and was laughing the whole time as well, so I recommend this movie for everyone.,Don't listen to the haters. This movie has SMART comedy, which I find cinema is lacking so much. I went on opening night to the cinema and the theatre was PACKED. Everyone was laughing the whole way throughout. The fact that this movie has such a low rating just baffles me, and shows blatant prejudice and sexism towards this smart and successful actress and comedy writer. Please don't listen to the poor reviews.,10/10",I Feel Pretty,10
Difficult to Rate,"I surprisingly had a very difficult time rating this show, but I did and a 5 out of 10 is in my opinion a fair rating when you consider the series as a whole.,The reason it is so hard for me to rate this show is the simple fact that it has been on so very, very long. 621 episodes and growing, according to the numbers here on IMDb. And when a season lasts that long, it obviously will have stretches of good quality and stretches of bad quality. The Simpsons is no different.,Although the series does still make me chuckle here and there, the quality has completely fallen off in the show's later years. It suffered a sudden and terrible decline and I still feel very disappointed watching it, remember and ""missing"" the fantastic episodes of old.,Because that's the other extreme. When The Simpsons first went on the air, and for at least 8 seasons (to me, at least), it was one of the very best comedy shows ever produced. The characters were great, the writing was slick, it seemed like every single joke hit its mark and I laughed out loud all the time. It was one of the few ""can't miss"" shows I remember in my life, where Sundays at 8pm I just had to be home to watch it. Everyone talked about it, and regardless of how many seasons you think it lasted everyone considers those early years the ""golden age"" of the Simpsons.,I'm not sure if the problem is people leaving, or naturally running out of ideas after being on the air so long, or simple laziness, or the writers and staff getting old, but clearly at a point this show just went from the creative tops to something almost awful.,I'm basically averaging it out (6 years of awesomeness, 6 years of being OK, and since then being just bloody awful) to give this show a 5 out of 10. ,I know I'll be bashed by haters who find my rating too high, and Simpson-heads who can't believe anyone would go lower than 10, but this is the grade I think is fair for this show.",The Simpsons,5
A brilliant show that should be allowed to die,"What can I say about the Simpsons? Initially, let's start with the positives. Has there ever quite been a show like the Simpsons? I think not! Matt Groening and James L. Brooks have truly created something of great comical and philosophical magnitude. From seasons 1-13 (that's right, up to season 13!), comedy appropriate to the society was cleverly exploited, causing the Simpsons to become a global phenomenon for obvious reasons. Flaws in society were excavated; puns were dished out with a clean edge and, most profoundly, this was a cartoon that both enticed adults and children alike (paving the way for successful cartoons such as Family Guy and South Park; although neither would reach the success of The Simpsons). Now the negatives. From seasons 14-19, Simpsons episodes were mediocre, shamelessly brandishing celebrities left, right and centre and dishing out jokes that seemed force and less natural. The series still did have the spark that peaked interest and tickled the funny bone but, other than that, it was rather a disappointment. This, however, was nothing compared to the decline in quality from seasons 20-26! Story lines seemed to consist of depression in the Simpson household and offered little to no comedic value. In addition, celebrities not only made cameo appearances, but dominated episodes in which the plot was clearly strained and offered nothing (especially the disgusting 'Lisa goes Gaga' which seems to combine all of my points beautifully). The writers have quite literally lost the plot and the show really should be cancelled! It is hard to tell whether the show has become a sentimental attachment to Mr Groening or whether FOX are just too worried about losing money at the cancelling of this show. Whatever the reason, FOX or Matt Groening need to end this show so it can leave the spotlight retaining dignity and fond memories; otherwise, we may look back at the early episodes as a distant memory! I rate The Simpsons as a 10 simply because of its earlier brilliance and my loyalty: a testament to its early episodes!",The Simpsons,10
Heartwarming and frickin' funny,"I walked out of the theater smiling! This is such a feel good movie...and to be honest, we could all use some more (self) love and laughter in 2018.",I Feel Pretty,10
Lighthearted fun,"What a great movie, and Amy Schumer was perfect for the role. This movie deserves a much higher rating! A must-see for girl's night out.",I Feel Pretty,10
The Greatest,"The Simpsons is the greatest show ever to grace the screen! You have Homer always making funny comments and stupid remarks which never get old. While Bart, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie are always doing hilarious things. Then there is still the rest of Springfield such as Barney, Skinner, Ralph and such. This is the greatest show and I hope they never end it.",The Simpsons,10
Stop it already!! It was a funny movie,"This movie was great entertainment. The 2 and 3 Star people need to pick different movies! This is obviously not your genre. Amy Schumer did a great job and was super funny. Thanks for the laughs, girl. You rock!",I Feel Pretty,10
A hoot.!,Plenty of laughs and an excellent feel good movie!,I Feel Pretty,10
Blind loyalty and network greed has ruined what used to be an animated masterpiece,"Network: Fox; Genre: Animated Comedy, Parody, Satire; Content Rating: TV-PG (language, adult contend and animated nudity); Available: DVD and syndication everywhere; Perspective: Classic (star range: 1 - 5);,Seasons Reviewed: Season 12+ ,If someone had told me 10 years ago that I would one day be bored by 'The Simpsons', I would have called them crazy. But here we are and while 'The Simpsons' has become the longest running show on TV at the cost of its core integrity. ""Simpsons"" in its prime was the best things to grace the small screen. A funny, ground-breaking animated comedy with lightening-quick wit, insightful social and brilliantly integrated parody. It created its own universe with an entire town of original characters. Most importantly, it actually helped shape the sense of humor of an entire generation. That generation which has now grown up and is now creating animated shows in direct competition. ,""Simpsons"" is a pale shadow of its former greatness. It gradually slipping this way for several years, but it wasn't until the 2002 and 2003 seasons that the show really smashed up against the rocks for good. I used to delight in each new episode of ""Simpsons"". But now the show clunks along each week in what appears to be filling time. The free-wheeling gags it used to deliver with such ease are now weighted down by an unnecessary over importance on story. The show at its best may get off a funny, sharp one-liner every now and then. It's biggest asset currently is it's willingness and given latitude to slam its own network. I do delight in their ""Joe Millionaire"" on-air promo parodies or a recent episode where Homer calls to give the network an idea and the recording says something like ""If you know of another network's reality show we can rip off, press 2..."" ,So what happened? There really is no one thing that can easily be pointed out to all the late-commers and say ""this is what happened"" - you have to have traced the history. The 'jump the shark' moment could have come as early as the infamous Frank Grimes episode where our vision of The Simpson family was suddenly turned into something to aspire to instead of parody. It could be the legion of big name celebrities forced into every episode. To bring down a show as great as this, it was a slow convergence of several things. ,Watching it, 3 differences are evident on-screen at any given time: First, the stripping down most of the characters to 1-note cartoons. Notably, British favorite Homer Simpson going from child-like, hard-luck father to a rag-doll for wild animals to rip apart as each episode closes. I'm particularly appalled at its attempts to use Homer as a political mouthpiece. Did you know that a guy who once lit a Q-tip so he could see inside his brain has an active concern for global politics? Yeah, I didn't either. ,Secondly, the classic Baby Boomer voice of the series has evaporated and was replaced with contemporary generation X and Y jokes. Now, it's the internet and Tony Hawke. The voice of the series used to be one of creator Matt Groening's, seen through the eyes of Homer and Marge. That voice has been lost as the show has turned into an assembly line institution, repackaged and been homogenized for the masses and a new generation of writers lead by Ian Maxton-Graham has come in to ""keep it fresh"". ,Thirdly, it has run out of creative juice. Anyone who has stuck with the show long enough can see it literally re-telling jokes and recycle previous story lines. When the recycling becomes too obvious or the episode makes no sense, they merely double back and declare it all a big self-parody. Not even Al Jean (architect of the show in its prime and the Larry David of ""The Simpsons"") can save it now. ,Since the talented voice cast has remained the same low these many years, I put all the blame on this squarely with the Fox network who refused to let this show go out gracefully when Groening siphoned off his role to work on his dream project, the now far superior 'Futurama'. In Fox's race to claim this endurance record they have turned a once edgy and visionary show into an institution with an assembly line production and revolving door of writers to match any of the other lame shows on TV. Behind the scenes, maybe the condescending we-can-do-no-wrong attitude of Maxton-Graham has dealt the show its biggest death blow, while producer Mike Scully sat back and ineptly let Maxton-Graham run it into the ground. ,In the end, the biggest blame may actually land with the ""die-hard fans"" that embolden the show by letting it get away with this junk. Yes, ""The Simpsons"" was ground-breaking and every adult animation in the future owns it a bit of gratitude, but blind loyalty to a show only for how it performed in the past isn't healthy. ,Since it has hit long-running status the critical bandwagon jumping has begun and ""Simpsons"" is more popular than ever amongst critics that want to be on the inside of history. We've now reached a point where the bad episodes and bad entire seasons outweigh the good and that, I'm afraid, is going to be the sad legacy of ""Simpsons"" . A train-wreck of crass, childish humor, grainy animation, oddly misplaced satire and forced parodies of only the most obvious pop culture targets. ,10 years ago I didn't know what I would do without ""The Simpsons"" but now, particularly with the emergence of satisfying new adult animated shows ('Futurama', 'Family Guy' and 'South Park'), living without it might be pretty good. ,* * / 5",The Simpsons,
The Simpsons - is there any better show?,"With all my collection of video tapes and d.v.d.s I seem to find myself digging through my Simpsons box, when I need something to watch. It would be hard to pick a favorite episode, because of so many. It would be even harder to pick a least favorite because there is very few that could be less appealing. But boring is one thing that the Simpsons could never be considered. The writers have changed ideas, episode structure, and kept the Simpsons on a continuous exciting adventure. Anytime of the day or no matter what seems to be the mood , the Simpsons is always satisfying to to view even over and over and hours on end.",The Simpsons,10

Easily one of the best cartoon shows (or shows) of all time!,"This show may have gone downhill significantly over the years, but we have to remember how amazing it once was! After being introduced in animated shorts on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" in 1987, the Simpson family started out in their own show late in 1989, with a Chrismas special. The first season continued in 1990, and during the show's early days, it was controversial. At that point in time, it seems that society wasn't used to cartoon shows not being 100% kid-friendly. However, ""The Simpsons"" also turned out to be one groundbreaking series of the decade, and the controversy eventually died down (less kid-friendly cartoon shows have come since)!,The Simpsons are a dysfunctional American family who live in the city of Springfield. The parents are Homer (an overweight, lazy, aggressive simpleton who works at the local nuclear power plant) and Marge (usually a stay-at-home mother who tries her best to keep the rest of the family in line). The kids are Bart (a ten-year-old boy who very often gets in trouble, and doesn't usually do so well at school), Lisa (a very intelligent, gifted eight-year-old girl who plays the saxophone and usually does very well at school, but often has trouble with her social life), and Maggie (the youngest in the family, only a baby). The family owns two pets, a dog named Santa's Little Helper and a cat named Snowball. Various kinds of trouble for this family often arise, including Marge and Homer having trouble with their relationship, Bart or Lisa experiencing a problem at school, and so many other things! Wherever the Simpsons go, trouble seems to await!,The show has many excellent supporting characters, probably more than most shows do! They include Krusty the Clown (a wacky clown whose #1 fan is probably Bart), Mr. Burns (Homer's evil 104-year-old boss at the power plant), Waylon Smithers (Burns' assistant), the Flanders' (the Christian fundamentalist family who live next door to the Simpsons), Seymour Skinner (the principal of Springfield Elementary who is middle-aged and still lives with his mother), Agnes Skinner (Seymour's bossy mother), Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (a man from India who runs the local Kwik-E-Mart), Edna Krabappel (Bart's teacher, who often gives him trouble), Abraham J. ""Grampa"" Simpson (Homer's silly father, who lives at a retirement home and has a lot of history), Patty and Selma Bouvier (Marge's nasty, chain-smoking sisters, who hate Homer), Moe Szyslak (a local bartender who is easily fooled by Bart's crank calls), Barney Gumble (Homer's alcoholic friend who is usually only seen at Moe's), Lenny and Carl (two more of Homer's friends, who drink at Moe's with him and work at the power plant), Milhouse Van Houten (Bart's nerdy friend)...the list goes on! ,Aside from all the funny characters, ""The Simpsons"" has several other notable features, including lots of brilliant humour, excellent writing, social commentary, a lot of voice talent (most of the cast members provide the voices of several characters), impressive animation (even if the main characters are simply drawn), etc.! The Halloween episodes are a highlight as well, each featuring three short stories, which are generally less realistic than the plots for most regular episodes. There's really not much (if anything) to be said about the long-running, groundbreaking series that hasn't already been said many times, so I'm basically just repeating things that others have mentioned!,It has now been nearly eighteen years since ""The Simpsons"" started out in full episodes, and it currently holds the record for the longest-running cartoon show! Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, it hasn't been the same in recent years, gradually declining in quality. Personally, I can't stand watching new episodes. I certainly don't think they're horrendous, but they seem very stale, and certainly can't compare to the classics, making me feel as if I've lost something in my life. I know I'm certainly not the only fan who avoids new episodes, many others believe that it should have come to an end long ago. However, it's best not to dwell on the negative. What ""The Simpsons"" was in its heyday is not something to be forgotten, and clearly, television in the 1990s wouldn't have been the same without it!",The Simpsons,10

Great Fun!,"There were at least two scenes where I literally bowled over laughing and produced tears. This being said, I find it hard to believe all the bad reviews (5 times more from men than woman) considering there's only been ONE screening so far and I don't think these are viewers from a pre-screening. Just a hunch. So, the majority of the reviews in are not from people who've actually seen the film. I realize there is this vast cadre of men who want to live in their fantasy that Jonah Hill and Michael Cera not only save the world but date super models or Emma Stone, and Amy Schumer messes with that fantasy lens. She's cool, get over it. Notice women don't flock to down-vote all the ridiculous kung fu and superhero movies men like, where mostly all they do is grunt. Perspective.,On to I Feel Pretty. I wasn't sure what to expect. Train wreck was very good and then the next one with Goldie Hawn was...okay, but just okay. I thought the Michelle William's Avery character was great. I probably wouldn't have realized it was her if I hadn't seen her name in the title. It was nice to see her doing comedy again, as she was great in that movie with Kirsten Dunst I can't say on IMDB without it getting flagged. You know, the one about Watergate. It was great to see Aidy and Sasheer from SNL. Andy has such great delivery and Sasheer is so visually expressive with her comedy. She can say a lot with just a look. I was afraid when Amy had her dialogue with Busy and Aidy it was going to get a bit too preachy about women but it didn't. It addressed it just enough then expressed the rest with the comedy. ,I'm not going to say specific moments I thought were hilarious or really got me 'cause I don't want to spoil anything, but the physical comedy was great and the Andrea Zuckerman moment was very funny for me. We were thoroughly entertained by this film. Amy Schumer really put some of her best work in this and it's a definite fun movie to see with your friends, sister, whomever.",I Feel Pretty,8
Enjoyable movie,"I felt I had to write this review because I was really Impressed with this movie. I can honestly say I can not wait for this movie to go to DVD so I can watch it over and over. 
I'm not a Amy Schumacher fan if anything I avoid her movies.
I was watching another movie when the trailer for this movie came on and it had me laughing.
So when the movie came out in the cinema I treated myself to a movie night on my own. I wasn't really expecting much maybe a few laughs and that's if I didn't see all the only funny bits in the trailer. 
I'm not going to give any of the movie away only that yes it was predictable and that's OK because I like many other women can see ourself in this movie. How many times have we thought if only I was Skinner, prettier, and so on. I feel pretty teaches us it really is what is on the inside that we project on the outside. Confidence is really what we all need more off. 
I liked this movie because I could see myself in so much some of the silly things she does, the whole movie was laughing even the men with their partners.

A Most Enjoyable Film Which Endlessly Pulls at the Corners of Your Face,"Who would have thought that the sequel to a much-loved classic would, in my opinion, turn into such a stand-alone powerhouse!?!,Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle, does just that. ,Not only is it a virtual non-stop ride of hilarity and laugh-out-loud moments, and it is, but the chemistry among the adult cast members is practically flawless and lends to the easy banter and overflowing, genius, COMEDIC DIALOGUE which just SHINES. Every look, every gesture, every note from The Rock, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are perfection in that at no time do you doubt they are who they are supposed to be. Karen Gillan is adorable and gorgeous at the same time. The obvious fun they are having, despite what I imagine to be uncomfortable filming locales, is palpable, and as an audience member, _if you allow yourself to be_, you WILL be swept up and transported by it.,So, why ANY low ratings?,While the first Jumanji was 'fun', underneath the fun, there were dark layers. There is none of that here and perhaps, this is where some of the disconnect from its detractors comes from. Unlike the original Jumanji, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a fun, and funny, film throughout. ,In closing, quite to the contrary of what a couple of reviewers are saying about Robin Williams, such as: 'he'd be rolling over in his grave (over this movie)', Robin Williams was one of those rare and amazingly special individuals who found joy and humor in most everything, and who chose to share that with those of us who are lucky enough to be witness to some of the favorites he left behind. Personally, I find it in very bad taste and verging on offensive, that those who seem to not share the capacity to laugh or live the way he did, or the ability to laugh with the rest of us, and who lack the gift of both being able to give or receive the very humor which exuded from Mr. Williams, would dare say he would be doing anything other than laughing riotously while munching on some popcorn and watching this film.,Thank you, Robin Williams, for the precursor which was so fantastic, it brought about an equally wonderful sequel.,You are missed.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
A movie with power packed smoldering intensity,"Reboots can be tricky. While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers. 
Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.,The movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.,The bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.,All in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret. It will make you gasp, wonder and laugh hysterically. It is definitely worth a watch.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,7
BETTER than the ORIGINAL BY FAR!!! Loved it.,"I would say I gave it a 10 to balance out the bobo-heads with no funny-bone in their body's low scores, but no; this movie deserves a 10 and more. ,Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle is a stand-alone, HILARIOUS romp which leaves the original in the dust. Heck, HILARIOUS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. Note that this is not to say that the original Jumanji was bad. On the contrary, it was great, especially for when it was filmed and who better than SIR Robin Williams, but in terms of laugh-out-loud good fun and non-stop smiles, this Jumanji far outpaces and outdoes the original. ,While my BF and I have somewhat different tastes in movies, and he is not a Rock fan (he loved him as a wrestler, not so much as an actor), we both laughed SO MUCH while watching this. The Rock knocks it out of the park with equally stellar performances by Jack Black and Kevin Hart. What is even more fabulous is that it has kids humor, yes, but also 'thinking-people's humor' in the form of obscure little tidbits which are dropped here and there and keep you on your toes and grinning ear-to-ear. There is hardly any scene where you step out of the roller coaster ride of fun it sets you on from the moment they (and you) are IN Jumanji.,Do yourself a favor. Watch this, and if you don't laugh raucously at LEAST six times, seriously, consider what else might be wrong. In fact, if you read through some of the negative comments, you see the same old, bored, stagnant people complaining about it being ""too PC"", AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. Cry me a river. If you notice these people's other reviews, it is easy to see that anything that they consider too scary (read: progressive) to fit in the mold of their little minds and world, automatically gets relegated to the 1/10 pile. Shame.,In closing, this Jumanji gained a place within my favorite movies of all time, and the only thing which makes me sad about it, is that 1. I wonder if upon a fourth viewing (we saw it three times) through my 20th it will lose some of its luster; and 2. that it wasn't much, much longer, as I did not want the fun to end.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
Just plain Fun!,"We went to see this as part of the early screening for Amazon Prime members. I always worry that all the funniest parts of a movie are spoiled in the trailer leaving nothing left in the film. That isn't the case. I was either smiling or laughing the entire movie, as was the rest of the theater. Is it Citizen Kane? No. Was I going to the theater wanting to watch a drama that delved deep into the characters' lives? No, again.,Our 4 heroes are sent to detention where they discover and are consequently sucked into Jumanji. They become the avatars they chose for the game and must complete the object of the game without using up all their lives. They have to work together, as a team. It is so much fun. It's predictable, funny, cute and the most important, entertaining. The actors are great in it, including a few cameos that were unexpected. ,The humor isn't too crude, but still slapstick-y and funny. It was along the vein of Shrek, Rat Race, or Clue. Again, if you're looking for deep and can't stand watching a movie without questioning everything, skip this one. This is one of those movies I'll be buying just so I can put it on and laugh.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,9
Loved it,"Your going to be hard pressed to find a movie more over the top than Deadpool 2, David leitch takes it to a whole new level entirely. It works namely because the violence here is just to creative. Sure it defies all Logic most of the time, but i was laughing and having a rip-roaring time throughout.,Go into this movie knowing that it is a campy, corny, over the top superhero/action/comedy that is just about crazy shooting sequences and one-liners, and you'll be fine. Do not go into this movie expecting deep plot, meaningful conversations among characters, or anything remotely resembling a serious action or drama movie. ,Loved it....",Deadpool 2,10
Well done,"We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of this remake. The jokes are nonstop and witty. Characters are well fleshed out with each person playing a physical opposite of their persona outside of Jumanji. A little homage is paid to Alan Parrish at the beginning of the movie, and the movie continues, 20 years after the events of 1996.,The Rock is always fun, but shines as a scared nerd with no confidence. Karen Gillan is adorable as the socially awkward nerdy girl. Jack Black playing a self obsessed popular girl is laugh out loud funny. Kevin Hart as a shrunken jock with many assigned weaknesses is classic. ,All in all a nearly perfect family comedy that rises above lowest common denominator humor. Worth the trip to see it on the big screen. You do not have to see the original to appreciate it.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,9
Way beyond expectations!,"We went to see this movie today with the kids, and MAN: I had a blast! I expected it to be a nice movie, but I was so surprised by every single minute.,Jack Black is at his best in this kind of comedic roles. He's hilarious in this one too. Dwayne Johnson and the rest also give a very entertaining performance.,It is so much fun: I cannot stop talking about it!,I did have to force myself to stop thinking about Robin Williams, for emotional reasons. This movie is a great tribute to Robin.,Yes, it does have some continuity problems with the Robin Williams movie, but it's forgivable. The movie is full of action, good humor and special effects you'd wish they had back in 1995 with the first movie.',Go see it!",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
"Delivers the Hilarity, Vulgarity and Action-Packed Fun That I Wanted","I was able to see Deadpool 2 at an advance screening. Deadpool shook things up and delivered offbeat fun when diehard fans were looking for something new from the genre. I thought it was a surprisingly well-rounded movie that perfectly encapsulated its hero and lovingly poked fun at both itself and other genre tropes. It was among my favourite movies of 2016. When it comes to bringing the laughs, I think Deadpool 2 is just as funny as the original entry. There's even more meta jokes, the same gleefully dirty spirit carries over and some unexpected payoffs left me cackling. They build upon some of the previous memorable bits (I admire Ryan for being so willing to relentlessly skewer his filmography) without it going stale. Luckily, they didn't ruin the movie by putting all the funny bits in the trailer and there's plenty to enjoy. They weren't afraid to push the envelope with the humour and stick around past the finale for a truly epic bit that rolls during the credits.,We've got all your favourite players back from Deadpool and I want to credit the writers for giving the opportunity for the characters to grow. Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is his typical wise-cracking self but he's found happiness and the change in his relationship with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) has really impacted his outlook. Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) return as X-Men members and while they're familiar, they're attitude does change towards Deadpool's antics. We also get back Dopinder (Karan Soni), Weasel (T.J. Miller) and Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) as the rest of Wade's crew and they all bring something new or hilarious to the film. I also really liked the new members of the cast; Cable (Josh Brolin) and Domino (Zazie Beetz) lived up to the hype. Cable has more depth than I expected and a highlight of Deadpool 2 was how they worked in Domino's ability into the action. They were so creative in how her abilities changed the way the action flowed. I also really liked the character of Russell (Julian Dennison) and how they used him in the movie. He becomes the driving force of the plot and they shape his character in a way that finds a nice balance between too soft and too arrogant. If I had any complaints, Eddie Marsan's character is one of the weakest villains I've seen in the genre, he has little dimension and his screen time is limited. I also preferred the treatment of a few of the original characters in the initial installment (Negasonic and Blind Al were stronger in the first movie). Keep your eyes open for a couple of surprise appearances by a few famous faces in the X-Men lore. ,Director David Leitch is well known for his work in stunts and co-ordinating memorable action set pieces. This has carried over into his directorial efforts, I had a general knowledge of this going in, so I was expecting big things. Again, this movie rose to the task. It equals the original and, in some ways, surpasses it. I've already mentioned Domino, Colossus has a standout fight in the finale of the movie, the direction the movie decided to go with the initial X-Force mission was very surprising and I also liked Cable and Wade's first fight in the prison. The movie doesn't have a signature scene like the 12 bullets opening in Deadpool but there was never a moment that I was bored when the severed limbs were flying. Leitch and his team definitely got the job done and they balanced the humour and the thrills superbly. ,Ryan Reynolds followed up his signature turn as the foul-mouthed mercenary with an equally impressive performance. He's joined Hugh Jackman and Robert Downey Jr. as the benchmark of acting within the genre and I question if anyone else could even come close to him playing this character. Morena Baccarin still has great chemistry with Reynolds and their relationship remains as sweet as it did before. Brolin is appropriately cast as Cable, he lived up to high expectations and was appropriately gruff. Zazie Beetz is great as Domino, her casting was met with a lot of criticism but she's funny and I wish we had spent more time with her. Karan Soni carried over his charm from Deadpool as did Brianna Hildebrand. Julian Dennison did a solid job as Russell, I hadn't seen his previous work, but I can understand why so many people were excited to see him. Terry Crews, Bill Skarsgard, Lewis Tan and Rob Delaney were all good as the new X-Force members. Delaney was the standout as Peter. I also liked Stefan Kapicic and Leslie Uggams in their respective supporting parts.,One of the more surprisingly successful parts of the original Deadpool movie was the love story between Wade and Vanessa. It was surprisingly effective, and I dug the direction they took with it. Deadpool 2 is a story about family and while it still worked, it didn't tug at my heartstrings like the emotional core of the first one did. This isn't the fault of the actors or even the writers, it just didn't have the same impact.,In my opinion, this is a great sequel. It delivers a potent mix of both action and comedy. I was impressed that they refused to rest on the laurels of the original adventure and tried to do something new with it. If you found the first one too crude, too violent or too meta, I don't think this one will work for you. Its a movie that stands on its own, but you get the same creative expression as you did in the first one. I wouldn't say this is better than Deadpool, but it is on that same level for me. Its not perfect so I can't go all the way to a 10 but my actual rating is 9.5/10.",Deadpool 2,9
An improved formula!,"Before the viewing of this film, I lowered my expectations knowing that majority of sequels are not as good as it's predecessors, but luckily the cast and crew made sure that this sequel is better in every aspect. Deadpool 2 abounds in funny moments, action scenes and importantly emotional ones, which were kind of weak in the first installment. This sequel bring some teachable moments on the table, but not too much, so the core of the movie is still very Deadpool-esque. The humor is similar to that of the first, with couple more pop culture jokes which might be a problem for some viewers, but for the most part they are easily understandable with the basic knowledge of pop culture. Along with well known original cast, we have couple of newcomers who fit in the cast perfectly. Brolin has a lot of screentime and he delivers in each scene. It features very entertaining references and cameos, and has one of the funniest post credits scenes in superhero movies, so be sure to stick around untill the very end. All in all, Deadpool 2 is a movie that can be enjoyable not only for fans of superhero genre, but for all who want to have a laugh while enjoying interesting action scenes.",Deadpool 2,9
You're Going to Need a SEATBELT,"I used to have an IMDB account when I was a teen - or at least thought I did, but couldn't log on. In any case, I think I've visited here maybe twice in the last five years. Today though, after just getting back from watching this with my almost-grown kids, I had to make an account just to leave this review.,To begin, I'll never understand people. I can't believe the negative reviews. How could anyone not have laughed like hell while watching this and still have a pulse? I didn't go in expecting much, but I came out with a smile on my face. The girl is hot, Jack Black ""owns it"", I've never been overly enthused about Kevin Hart, but he was fantastic. and The Rock just knocked it out of the park. ,I saw one review which reads: ""not a wrestling fan ever so to see 'the rock' in movies, instantly puts me off!"" Does anyone else want to vomit at the inanity, irony and ludicrousness of that statement? Then you have the user who out of 40+ titles he/she has reviewed in the past has only ever rated TWO above three stars. Seriously, if you don't enjoy films and find them so terrible, find a new hobby already. You've got one guy saying the shirt one of the kids wore was outdated. So, I'm guessing one can only wear clothing depicting the current year? Then you have the reviewers who maybe didn't understand the dialogue since they can barely communicate correctly themselves (such gems - I kid you not - as: 'averege'; 'what so ever'; 'family fair' (fare); 'are just wasn't'; 'due to it has'; 'all of there' {their); 'coz it is boring story'; 'no compare with'). Finally, you have the maybe half dozen reviewers who are so caught up in their bigotry that they can't relax and enjoy a film if it isn't whitewashed and who complain about the ""Hollywood liberal agenda of diversity"". Leave the politics at the door, man.
In short, Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle was a fantastic hour or more of rip-riding fun and laughs.,Except for one very funny moment, Dwayne Johnson retires his wrestling persona for this film and instead, provides a smoldering and intense performance, riddled with good-natured hilarity as the lead in this film. Gillan was great in Doctor Who, and although I thought she was the weakest of both characters and actors in this film, she still held her own and looked fantastic doing so. She has one of those faces you can't help but love. Kevin Hart was fantastic as the diminutive valet and looking back, I think he was somehow involved in every funny moment in which I laughed the hardest. Finally, the master, the maestro (though I never really was a fan prior to this), Jack Black plays the teen beauty queen with 100% commitment and to perfection.,10/10 and definitely a film I will be purchasing right after I click ""Submit"". You can never have enough laughter in life, and Jumanji, Welcome to the Jungle delivers barrels-full.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
Critics undersell a fantastic movie,"I would watch this movie two more times at least. This was a very funny movie. Arguably one of the best performance Jack Black has done. When I watched this with my family, in a packed movie theatre, I kid you not, the entire cinema was laughing during quite a few of the scenes. The humour is excellently tailored to the audience and is a beautiful tribute to the original Jumanji with Robin Williams. The way it fantastically coincides with the original movie and moves onto a sort of sequel to this is beautiful, and a rare thing these days. The movie is very funny and easily one of the greatest movies to have come out this year. It is certainly in the top 15 movies that have come out, post 2010, accompanied with the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool and now the recent movie that just came out, Bright. If you felt that Bright was also under-appreciated by movie critics, the exact same thing has happened here as Jumanji is a 100% gaurantee, a movie that will be appreciated after watching. Personally, I would watch it again and again with people. It is not just a movie to watch and discard, this is one to put on the bookshelf and watch again in the future. Loved it. Thank you for such a great movie with a fantastic and fun cast who clearly have great chemistry on and off the screen.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
Better than the first one!,"I wasn't expecting it to be THAT good! It takes everything that was great about the first one and makes it even better!,David Leitch proves once again to be one of the best current directors in the genre of action, with really gory, fun fights. Also, the whole cast is great, but my favorite was Josh Brolin as Cable, I even liked him more here than in Infinity War.,If you liked the first one, please, go check this out!",Deadpool 2,9
Well-Done Action Packed Sequel,"As you expected, Deadpool 2 is all that we expected and above. The action does not stop almost the entire movie, the new characters are great especially Cable and Domino. The humor as you expected is something without which the movie will not be the same ... yet it is a distinctive feature for the character of Deadpool.,The story is good and you can expect some surprising people to interfere in the the movie, but I will not tell you, see for yourself. The effects are very good, the music choice fits great with the action scenes and the individual moments in the movie.,Supporting roles also do not lag behind and accumulate a lot of points. If I have to determine which is the best part of the movie, then that's undoubtedly Josh Brolin as Cable.,I advise you to stay to the end of the movie, there are some pretty good things waiting for you (aftercredit scenses).",Deadpool 2,10
Hilarious reboot!,"I was skeptical at first but found myself in full belly laugh within the first few minutes! Cool idea, amazing actors, unique story arc on the Jumanji name. And it's a family movie too, despite a few words from Kevin Hart... I recommend!",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
Same old Hollywood Garbage,"A disgrace to the original, full of talentless actors. The comedy was stale and the storyline was rather boring. I was able to complete a five page term paper while it was on screen. The graphics are the only appealing thing about it. Get new ideas, Hollywood! And get some fresh faces on the screen!",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,4
Lots and Lots and Lots and Lots of Fun!,"All of the performers are fantastic in this film, and are perfect fits for their roles. The group dynamics are excellent, and they all have hilarious back-and-forths with each other. Some of my favorite moments in the movie are when everyone is simply standing around talking. Dwayne Johnson really shows his comedic talents here. While he does have a few scenes where he gets to show off his action chops, most of his role is comedy-heavy, and he delivers on it. Kevin Hart plays the same character he always plays, and more times than not it annoys me, but for whatever reason here it works. Maybe it's his chemistry with the other actors, but he's hysterical in this movie. I'm not a huge fan of Karen Gillan's character of Nebula in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, so I wasn't sure how she was going to be in this. But she delivers as well. Not only does she nail the action beats (and she has some of the best in the whole movie), but she also has some great comedic moments, comedy that I didn't know she could pull off as well as she did. But the true star of this movie is Jack Black. I thought he was hysterical in the trailer, but I was afraid that the concept of him actually being a teenage girl would get old and annoying quick, but it doesn't. Black is perfect for this role, and nails every comedic moment he's given. They are all fantastic together, and it makes for some great entertainment...",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,9
Yes believe the hype!!!!,"REVIEW - DEADPOOL 2,Anyone who reads these reviews knows my feelings about sequels and prequels and if you don't I'll just say it once more, they are never as good as the original! ,But......................,Deadpool 2 is one of a very few which is actually better than the original. ,Yes it's dubstep above the original, it runs big huge rings around the original, it laughs in the face of the original while dancing to dubstep.,I never write spoilers and won't start here, all I will say is that you will openly be laughing at so many in gags, far more than in any of the trailers, they kept the best for the film and the trailers don't spoil the film in any way shape or form. ,A definite MUST SEE!!!!! ,Yes believe the hype!!!!,Rating 10 out of 10",Deadpool 2,10
Humorous drama that tickles both your brain and body,"Ever since DP became a sensation and a worldwide phenomenon, die-hard fans have been asking for a worthey second entry. ,For a long time, superhero movies - not to be confused with films based on graphic novels, which is an interesting item of truth - have become a pinata for serious film critics and reasons are not lacking because we are talking about a cataract of conservative products, mediocre and totally interchangeable with each other. Typical examples of what happens when marketing and advertising discourse replace creativity and some kind of narrative, rhetorical and / or even formal talent (the stories of these ""cosos"" are otherwise schematic , do not say anything at all and are even hyper redundant in terms of digital gadgets, today present in all sad pompous proposal of the mainstream). But perhaps the worst of all is that they bore with their childish and semi-televised dialectic - from the TV of yesteryear - oriented to reproduce ad infinitum the same antics.,With this panorama it is not surprising that even the exponents who try to break a couple of rules of the format end up falling into the usual quagmire of non-development of characters, the most ancient political correctness, the humor for young children, that pathetic self-referentiality and constant a concatenation of prefixed niches of the market - it is not even possible to call them subframes - that can only appeal to a series of individuals co-opted by the most aseptic industry, the one that for a couple of decades has decided to ignore any nonconformist substrate at the level of the ideological basis of their ""toys"". ,Deadpool 2 is another link in this endless chain of perky fun-time itself (hobby products that do not even pass the time), which once again highlights the crisis of a cultural conglomerate that fetishes the most burned clichés.,Pretending to be ""set sail"" for the puerile level of superhero movies, this sequel to the work of 2016 essentially repeats the formula of its predecessor: many jokes with harmless puteadas, some very innocuous sexual allusion, scenes of action that are ironic, Tired questioning to camera and a cheap background melodrama that sabotages itself because the movie-read the Marvel factory-does not understand that because of so much ""attitude surpassed of everything"", both beretta cancherism and so many plastic simulated CGIs, nobody can identify with these shiny but well-emptied jars from a rusty and insipid assembly line. ,In other words, DP2 is the perfect sequel to DP, specifically. Doubles down on everything that fans love about the original, nonstop graphic violence, gore, torture, sex, nudity, swearing, drinking, drug use, and more, so expect the same here, while it fixes some of the first film's issues. Also this one features the best post credits scene EVER. Yes! Deadpool 2 as the title says, gives the audience two end-credit scenes. Ladies and gentlemen, the wait for the scenes are worth it! Hilarious is the perfect word to describe how the audience feels of watching 'em. They don't relate much with the whole story but the crack jokes are powerful enough to make people care of the clips. ,The sequel is superior to its ancestor. It conveys silly comic drama that stimulates both your cerebrum and body.",Deadpool 2,8
Excellent Cast and a Great Show!!,"Dwayne Johnson just keeps getting better with age. Jack Black and Kevin Hart are very talented actors who know how to temper their roles just enough to compliment the movie. Enjoyed this movie with all the action, unpredicatability and creative direction and scenes. High Recommend!",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
Great Movie. Go see it already!,Fun movie for family. Silly at times with decent action and interesting people. If you are a guy wanting to bring wife/girlfriend to movie you'll both walk out feeling you got your money's worth then this is a great pick. It won't win any fancy awards but best movie in theaters right now.,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
Not as good as the first one,"After really looking forward to this movie, I came out of the cinema slightly disappointed. Theres plenty of joke and action but the jokes seemed to be a bit meh, I only remembered laughing out loud twice and story line is a bit disjointed. The problem I had is in the DP 1 you had the shock factor of a tongue in cheek mavel character but in this movie that's already gone, so you have to rely on a good plot but unfortunately it lacked that, so I felt a little bit bored by it. I'm not saying it not a good movie but I expected a lot more but sadly I felt let down.",Deadpool 2,6
Simply Horrible,"This movie was a waste of time to see. After seeing the first one when it came out, We went to see this one last night. I figured this one this one would be somewhere close in comparison to the original, but MAN WAS I WRONG. Ryan Reynolds must have been desperate. The entire movie was simply horrible. Over half of the people in the nearly sold out theater got up and walked out before it was half over, so I am not the only one that thought this way. Hopefully, they do not come out with a #3..",Deadpool 2,1
"Awesome, just awesome!","Heard about another Jumanji Film being made, but thought it was going to be a remake of sorts. Well, through years of development it seems to be more of a different take on the 1995 classic! And a good take it was!,Starting at 1996, a young man finds a ""board game"" on the beach after hearing the iconic ""jungle drums"" sound emitting from the box partially covered in sand. Like the original, he finds it, takes it home with him, & then finds out it's an Nintendo like game & plugs it into his console & starts playing, he gets sucked in & is trapped in the game, similar to the original, but as a computer games console, not a board game, interesting take.,So fast forward 21 years later, & 4 young teens who all come together via detention play the game & get sucked in after finding it in a store room in the school. It's then they find themselves in different bodies & each have 3 lives like that of a computer console game. They then learn of the curse of the jungle via a green jewel & must place it back where it was & shout ""Jumanji!"".,The film I thought was pretty good! Of course it wouldn't be nearly as good as it's counter back in '95, but it's pretty damn close to be an original & somewhat is! The story was simple & easy to follow, the characters were great & likable, Karen Gillan was a babe in this film! (sorry had to say it!), but she & the others were great! I also liked the humour in this film too! It was funny & fitted well!,I was kind of peeved it wasn't set in the real world as appose to a jungle, but I suppose it was because they were sucked into a different world so it made sense in a way, & it wasn't too bad either!,Overall this film was a good watch & matches pretty well with the original film! 9/10 Go watch it!",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,9
Nice sequel! Better than my expectation,"I actually come to watch this movie with low expectation. I watched 1st Jumanji and it was really great (and I watched it a couple times). The sequel is a little different with it's successor, with the theme is still same, a game that involved real adventures to it's player. Four teenagers sucked into the game, and they become a character they chose (which is very different from their real life). The movie is so funny, and if you played RPGs game you will find this really entertaining. The humour is still suitable for young audiences, so it's a family movie too. And while it's a humour adventures movie, it still have a good message. So I really recommend it, hope you'll enjoy it too.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,9
One of the best movies ever created,This is a great movie and I have watched it over many times. Highly recommend this movie.,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
Overrated movie,Overrated. Too much stupid jokes that you know every serious scene will be followed with a stupid joke next,Deadpool 2,1
Totally unimpressed,"I had high hopes coming to this movie but I must say it was chaos everywhere! The story line isn't great and although I normally find Ryan's comedy natural it does overstep and get annoying quite frequently in this outing.
I was surprised to find myself fiddling with my phone while watching this because I was bored. Overly foul language that doesn't make sense. It's so bad that I will not be watching this again.
Not impressed at all. Thumbs-down Marvel",Deadpool 2,1
"Very, very fun and worth your time!","The original Jumanji was supposed to be a one-and-done film, even though it teased the potential for a sequel. Many voiced trepidation at the prospect of a sequel after all these years later, and after the tragic death of original star Robin Williams, there were valid concerns about whether this sequel could be both a good movie and a fitting sequel and tribute to what had come before.,I am glad to report that it fulfilled all expectations.,The film relies almost entirely on its star power, and it has that in spades with the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. Where the charm resides, though, is the actors playing against their types through the means of real-world to video game body switching: The Rock embodying a nerdy hypochondriac, Hart an all-star jock, Gillan a shy insecure reject, and perhaps most brilliant of them all, Black housing a she's-all-that pretty girl. Together our four teenage protagonists get sucked into the video game incarnation of Jumanji, a jungle land that is threatened from the typical video game threat, and our heroes must do the usual video game tasks in order to beat the game and return to the real world, all without getting killed in-game, which will get them killed in real life after three lives.,The film thematically treads the same sort of ground that other teen movies tend to cover, mainly the stereotypical high school tropes get thrust into a situation that forces them to work together to correct each other's flaws and by the end they return to their 'normal' lives as better people.,What the film does different in the body-switching is that these tropes are transferred onto adult actors, people who each have tropes of their own, and the way that each actor gets to play against their type is definitely what makes this movie so fun.,On the flipside, like a video game, the villain is very one- dimensional, and while the narrative isn't necessarily harmed by it, it does stand out as something that's lacking, wishing that the villain was more than just 'I will kill you because reasons'.,Also, the character introductions in the real world at the beginning of the film feel very forced, as in we all know they end up in the game, and the reasons they get into the situation feel very convenient, as if the writers could not find an elegant means to get these four people in the same place in front of the game console at the same time, so they just threw them all together.,These are fairly minor nitpicks, as the pace of this film is fast, it doesn't really drag at all, and while they do repeat a joke or two, it doesn't step over the line into annoying. All this makes for a very fun film, definitely worth your time this holiday season, and after once it gets released on home media.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,8
Fantastic movie!,"Really enjoyable movie! The movie is well paced, great cast, great action sequences. I think this is a must see movie, for all the family.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,9
84% On Rotten Tomatoes?????????????????????,How in the hell could Justice League get a 40% and this garbage get 84? Suicide Squad and Transformers The Last Knight were both awful but 100 times better than this glorified student film. How is it humanly possible for movie critics to give this pile of dung the same rating as Infinity War? It just cant be!!!!!!!! I saw this for free and still feel cheated.,Deadpool 2,1
A complete waste of time,The movie is so disjointed and unstructured. Just felt like a bunch of scenes stitched together with no editing. A few (and I mean a few) funny moments and a waste of time for the vast majority of the movie. Enough with the superhero movies already!,Deadpool 2,1
That joke isn't funny anymore,"An unfunny mess from start to finish. No soul, recycled humour, weak story and phoned in performances. Reynolds and Brolin seemed bored. I know I was too.",Deadpool 2,1
One of the best action films I've seen in a while,"I'll start out by saying that my family is a really big fan of the Robin Williams/Bonnie Hunt Jumanji movie, I personally thought it was alright. Nothing great, but not bad either. I went into this movie with my doubts about it's quality. One, because I wasn't the biggest fan of the original, and two because I was fearful it would just be another generic action romp. I was WRONG. This is one of the best action films I've seen in some time, and there are many reasons as to why this one works so well. Reason number one: the casting. This cast is just perfectly put together. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson really was great in the lead role, one of his best performances in my opinion. Kevin Hart serves as the ever hilarious comedic relief, and he did a fabulous job of making the audience laugh their asses off. Jack Black is really great here as well, very funny, really the best middle aged man in Hollywood you could pick to play as a teenage girl stuck in another body. And lastly, Karen Gillan and Nick Jonas give fun entertaining performances. The acting is a big plus for this movie. Reason number two: the writing. The script allows for many things: comedy, action, and some serious stuff too. Funny lines for the comedic heavyweights and more touching/sweet content for when it's called for. And finally, reason number three: very exciting action and effects. The action scenes are done well and achieve the level of excitement that they are going for. And the visual effects are top of the line as well. Overall, this is just a great film overall, and it even gave a small harken back to the original 90s film. Great lovable characters, exciting action, skilled writing... just a joy overall. 9/10 for Jumanji: Welcome to the jungle.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,9
Awesome fun,"Four high school kids discover an old video game console and are drawn into the game's jungle setting, literally becoming the adult avatars they chose. What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji - you must survive it. To beat the game and return to the real world, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, discover what Alan Parrish left 20 years ago, and change the way they think about themselves - or they'll be stuck in the game forever.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
Better than I expected,"I saw the previous Jumanji (95) and it was always dearest to my heart. I was REALLY skeptical in watching this one. It looked like they were going to ruin the first one and make it more commercial. At the end of the day that is exactly what they did! But I did not expect it would be so but so much fun to watch! Could barely stop laughing!
Enjoyed it <3",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
A complete waste of time,Last among all marvel as well as x men movies. even deadpool one was better,Deadpool 2,1
No more sequels please,"Did you ever have a friend who constantly made snide remarks to try to make people laugh in order to draw attention to themselves and become liked? It works at first but after awhile becomes so annoying people quit laughing and just start ignoring the person. That basically sums up this movie. Funny for about 10 minutes, tolerable for the next 10 minutes, and annoying for the rest of the movie.,As a result this movie quickly became a long, boring, clichéd. over hyped, unfunny, annoying, and disappointing mess. Linear storyline, no plot twists, forgettable characters (with the exception of Domino), uneven pacing, marginal acting, and just totally forgettable. The entire movie was lazy writing!,One star for the character of Domino and one star for the rather interesting trailer insert at then end of the movie but other than that not worth watching much less paying to see it first run.,Look for this one to be out in DVD by July and in the discount movie bins at Walmart by Christmas.",Deadpool 2,2
"It's not hate, it's love.","Yes, love for the movies. That's what provokes that feeling of ""Oh no!"" What's going on? Incapable of original ideas?

""Tootsie"" was decades ago, Death Becomes Her, elegant and original with room for actors to create characters even outlandish ones but Death Becomes Her was in the 90's. Now a barrage of sequels or movies from TV shows. There is no hate in what I'm saying that will be insane, no, the opposite is true. Call it tough love. I'm not going to be an enabler with my silence.",Overboard,2
Loved it. A great family show.,I think the concept of how teenagers get transported into seasoned actors in a different world is something new to me. I really enjoyed the humor and the way the story flows. My wife and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly and we left the show feeling satisfied.,Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,10
This Movie is Pure Fun!,"The steady and impressive box office success is well-deserved. This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. , No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. , Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. ""Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!"" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much., Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.
 
Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch)., Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car ""why can't you just drive us where we need to go?"" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is., Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with ""I'm just saying you're a babe."" Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short., These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,

A failure from every possible angle,"What happens when you take a classic beloved comedy, switch the gender roles to jump on the P.C. bandwagon, give it to two unqualified directors with no experience in feature films, cast two actors with less chemistry than a frog and an old shoe, put the entire plot in the trailer, and then release it to theaters? ,You get an entire world of people, especially fans of the original, wondering why the studio even bothered.,I have no problem with remakes as long as they're enjoyable, but this one isn't. Not even a little. If you're going to remake a film, have a reason for remaking it. Add something new to it. And switching gender roles isn't ""new."" Hasn't been for a long time. ,This is a truly weak effort every step of the way, even from the normally enjoyable Farris who sleepwalks through every scene. Guess she had some extra time to kill between seasons of her sitcom Mom, or maybe she just needed the cash to supliment the millions she probably got from divorcing Chris Pratt. Whatever the reason, she needs to fire her agent. ,Look, if you must see this, wait until it's on cable, but only if there's nothing else on the other 2,000 channels.",Overboard,2
Exciting and Fun but it's not Jumanji,"Jumanji 1995 has many memorial moments for example: The reveal of the Jumanji board, monkeys robbing a police car, the stampede, sinking floors, the flooded room with some crocodiles, the incredible use of the sound track, basically a lot of stuff. The original is well crafted and now it's 2017 and we have Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. It's a fun, action comedy film with really cool references to the first film but as much as it entertains me it's not Jumanji. As Robin Williams said ""I've seen things you've only seen in your nightmares"" but in this film the jungle is safe enough to make margaritas and have scented candles on display. Dwayne Johnson tries to play a geeky character but he still plays that big tough guy. Kevin Hart plays himself nothing new, Karen Gillan plays a geeky shy girl and she has done that before and finally the highlight of the film is Jack Black playing as a teenage girl named Bethany. Everything Jack says is incredibly funny and will leave you falling off your seat. Like I said before it's not Jumanji, 6.5/10.",Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,6

"I don´t understand the good reviews. ""10/10"" Smells like paid liars.","I watched the 1987 version with the great Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. I hate comparisons but this version is very away to be original.
The acting is AWFUL, Mr. Eugenio Derbez invited his tribe of friends actors and they don´t know how to act. They came from a lousy Mexican broadcast company named ""Televisa"" a bad soap opera factory.
I love Mexican starts, but this is not the case.
Since the movie starts, I wanted to end it quickly. It was a torture to me.
There is any effort to reinvent the comedy, they are lousy choose of cast.
There is no chemistry between Faris and Derbez.

Yes it is a remake... and it made laugh a lot.,"Hollywood loves to gamble on remakes. They bet on our nostalgia and love for the originals. But this movie has it's own soul. Not only modernizes this classic from Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, it gives it a unique identity by mixing accomplished actors with different nationalities. Eugenio Derbez is a successful Mexican Comedian and Anna Farris is as cute as funny as she has always been, and the 2 of them give balance and heart to this movie. It is fun to watch and lighthearted. Not an Oscar-winning movie, but truly a fun movie to spend 90 minutes laughing. WARNING: The jokes have a mixture of US and Mexican humor. You may not get all of them, but you will still have fun with the actors' performances.",Overboard,10
Simply dreadful,"Consider this a public service.,The new Overboard remake is simply dreadful. Where the original was light and funny and endlessly quotable, the remake is flat, depressing, and basically comes off as a ""Spanish 101 lesson for Gringos"".,Anna Faris generally strikes me as fairly funny in her other work but even she can't right this sinking ship. Eugenio Derbez captures none of Goldie Hawn's hilarious, over-the-top pretentiousness, Swoosie Kurtz is an abomination in the insane mother role so superbly executed by Katherine Helmond in the original. John Hannah is his usual charming self as the beleaguered ""Andrew"" but he's given almost nothing to work with, whereas Roddy McDowell ( both acting and exec. producer in the original) steals many classic scenes.,The kids are dreadful. The rich relatives are dreadful. The poor friends, including Eva Longoria... dreadful.,Run, don't walk, away from this picture.",Overboard,2
The smartest thing Fox has done yet,"This is the funniest show currently on television. All you need to enjoy this show is an appreciation for high-quality acting and incredibly hilarious writing. Jason Bateman as Michael Bluth is perfect as the under-appreciated do-good guy who's just trying to keep his family together and himself sane. Other highlights of the show include Will Arnett as GOB (George Oscar Bluth II), Michael's lame-excuse-for-a-magician brother; Jeffrey Tambor as George Sr., Michael's incarcerated father (he was jailed for ""shifty accounting practices""); and Michael Cera as George Michael Bluth, Michael Bluth's perpetually nervous 13-year-old son (who just happens to have a strange infatuation with his cousin, Maebe, played by ""State of Grace""'s Alia Shawkat). All in all this show is sure to be a hit, at least with those people whose level of understanding of comedy is above slapstick and bathroom jokes. TREMENDOUSLY hilarious writing and outstanding performances by the whole cast will have you laughing the whole time. Ten out of ten!",Arrested Development,10
Great TV,"Strange, Fox's promos almost made me miss out on this whole thing.,It's a sit-com made with very high standards, it's a career revival for Ron Howard, Henry Winkler and Liza Minelli, and it's a show that puts Fox's profile into HBO territory. ""It's Arrested Development"",""In fact..."", a Ron Howard quote that has become a cliché around our house, in fact, it's all those things and more. The writing is as good as everyone says it is, the cast is on par with that of Seinfeld or Roseanne. (Say what you will about her, that was a dream cast) Whenever new characters appear, they are inevitably played by people familiar to fans of edgy, intelligent humor. People like Jeffrey Tambor and Jason Bateman are dependably good, Michael Cera is a standout, and David Cross is finally being seen for the talent that he is. ,The strongest thing I can say about this is that I find myself repeating various running gags, things that, like ""In fact..."", have become clichés. ""I've made a huge mistake."" ""I'm having the time of my LIFE in here!"" ""surprisingly cat-like"" ""Take a powder, willya fellas?"",This last one, uttered by Liza Minelli as Lucille Austero, sticks with me especially, and I hope that Liza stays with the show longer. As good as the principles are, she manages to outclass even them. The same with Henry Winkler, whose Barry Zuckercorn is the sort of lawyer television's been dying for. Among those main players, Lindsay and Tobias are pretty strange characters to begin with, but when you consider that they are an old married couple, that crosses the line into the bizarre. This show is full of people and situations you just won't see anywhere else, at least until other derivative shows start appearing.,Watch carefully, as there are many bit and pieces lingering in the background that you might miss. Recently, George Michael was dumped by his girlfriend. As he trudged home in a state of misery, you could hear sad Charlie Brown music. In the background, you could see a real - but bright red - dog house, with a real dog lying on top of it. It's things like these that tell me that the creators are just pleased to be doing this show for it's own sake, and that kind of love of the work shows through in the end.,Who knows if this show will last? There's an audience out there for this sort of thing, but they've generally settled into the Sunday night HBO schedule. Hopefully the Emmys, the word of mouth, and the critical raves will draw attention to this show. If not, we'll just have our A.D. dvds to keep us warm, and thank God for 'em!",Arrested Development,

UNparalleled,"You've doubtless heard fans rave and rave about this show, and may have even checked it out. The camp is sharply divided, people either absolutely love it, or tend to just ""not get it."" In that sense it may not be for everyone (great television, and great art in general, rarely is), and to each his own. But after watching each season multiple times, I can easily say that it is the funniest show that I have ever seen by an ENORMOUS margin. Even after many repeat viewings, I still end up in tears all the time.,DVD treats this series well simply because it suits itself to rapid digestion (and after getting hooked, you won't be able to get up). The writers include many, many running gags that persist through entire seasons, or even the entire series (""I've made a huge mistake."" ""Her?""). The entire cast is extremely WELL cast and everyone's comedic timing is spot on. The real stars are David Cross as Tobias, and Will Arnett as GOB. Their physical comedy is drop dead hilarious as well. But Jessica Walters and Jeffrey Tambor are phenomenal, the former most especially in the third season.,As others have stated there is no laugh track and this is part of what throws some of the ""we don't get it"" camp off. The humor is very fast paced as well, and many of the biggest laughs are very subtle physical comedy, or a line of dialog that is dropped in the midst of a conversation. Some of the music that was written for the show is absolutely hilarious as well, especially the song that plays often when George Micheal is put in an awkward (sexual) situation (""whatcha trying to say to me??"").,Start with season 1, give it 4 episodes (go through at least the episode ""key decisions"" which I believe is ep 4). If you're not hooked, or at least intrigued by then, its likely you wont be at all. But if you're like me, and MANY others, you'll find that you've just stumbled upon one of the greatest shows ever made. VERY highly recommended. 10/10",Arrested Development,10

HI-Larious as Well As Intelligent,"In this age of lazily-conceived, hastily-produced, fill-in-the-blank reality shows that the FOX network seems to corner the market on, it's refreshing to see them invest in a show that doesn't fit a clichéd formula and challenges the audience's intellect with hilarious results.,Previously, I had written off this show without giving it a chance, assuming that it's just another show about rich people with problems, a la ""The OC"". It's too bad I didn't give it a chance because I just happened to watch a random episode right while waiting for ""Malcom in the Middle"". Little did I expect to laugh so hard at George Michael continuously wearing a muscle suit just because his COUSIN. Maebe, gave him a passing compliment. And the absurdity of the situation was amplified by Ron Howard's deadpan narration of the episode, giving it the seriousness the situation doesn't deserve.,The show was still confusing because I wasn't clear on all the relationships and the origninating humor that the episodes look back to. Good think FOX did a marathon of the show in order to set me straight.,Bottom line, this show did not win all those Emmies for nothing. It could give Frasier, Friends and Seinfeld a run for their money any day.

Cable was completely ruined and Domino is now a ditsy clown. They couldn't have selected a worse actor for the character for Nathan.

One son, Michael, tries to be responsible and keep things going, while the rest of the group is entirely self-centered and can't seem to focus on the fact they are broke and in disgrace.,The various family members go off in various directions:  George (GOB) fancies himself a magician, Buster is a momma's boy, Lindsay goes off supporting odd causes, Lindsay's husband Tobias fancies himself an actor.

I've seen the second season and I have to say it right on par with the first with more funny twist and situations that Michael and the Bluths have to deal with. Yes they changed some of the story lines now (George Sr. on the run, Gob taking over the company, Buster threating to join the army, and so forth) but THATS HOW SEASONS GO. If they kept the same storyline from the first the show would've haven't gotten repetitive before the first two episodes.

With that said, the new Overboard has some touching moments and a few fun performances, even if it's ultimately about as predictable and forgettable as you can imagine.

"Putting the ""vision"" in television.....","There was a time during what is commonly known as The Golden Age of Television when the medium was used to communicate. It was used to entertain, inspire, and evoke a connection with the people. There was time in television when the programs would challenge not only the standard, but also the viewer. It started with things like Sanford & Son and All In the Family. Then the Richard Pryor Show shook people to the bone. From these gems came further explorations of the comic genre. We were treated to things like The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Seinfeld. Shows that broke the mold of the typical sitcom formula. They found their actors and made them stars. They didn't take washed up has-been film actors and try to turn them into the affable characters that they obviously were not. They simply took fresh talent and gave them the environment to get better and eventually captivate. ,Then something terrible happened in 1993. A show, on what was supposed to be a music video network, got the idea to film real people living together in a house. From the first episode of The Real World, the Golden Age of Television was over. From this little show spawned a countless number of reality TV Shows that have paved the way for mind numbing experiences of watching people acting ""real"" while they are being filmed. It showed us all that not only is this medium of television completely unoriginal, but that it also provided people with insight into just how far somebody will go to get themselves on the airwaves. In 1994 something else happened. A little show called ""Friends"" hit the desk of the execs at NBC. From that we now have an endless string of formulaic, hokey, poorly written buddy sitcoms, all focusing on the same issues that plague the ""poor"" yuppie world that these people all seem to inhabit. Gone was the time when you didn't really need the laugh track; gone was the time of multi-plot line programming.,And then, something truly amazing and inspiring happened. In a collaborative effort from the Hurwitz Company and Imagine Entertainment came a brilliant piece of intelligent programming; a show that had no precedent. A truly talented ensemble cast, a brilliant writing team, and an amazing staff of directors and photographers that changed the art form like never before. Gone were the days of traditional, canned laughter sitcoms. It seems that we had all been saved from another infinite line of weak programs, and by whom? The FOX Network. Who would have thunk it? But then again, it made perfect sense. FOX brought us The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Family Guy. They had been known to challenge the bar that was set by regular programming. But instead of living on with those classics, it was forced to willow away in the doldrums of cancellation alongside other brilliant yet failed shows, like Action, Titus, and Greg the Bunny. Some people like to watch clichéd, overplayed, over done formulas every week. Some people like the safe humor, the one-two camera angles, the boring sets, and the canned laughter. Some people just don't want to think. The rest of usthe rest of us watch Arrested Development.",Arrested Development,10
First Season on DVD Disk 1 - Highly Recommended!!!,"We enjoyed re-discovering the amazing antics of the Bluth family and preparing ourselves for the much anticipated second season. Arrested Development is my kind of situation comedy. No laugh tracks, thank you for respecting our intelligence! When it's funny, we know when to laugh. There are lots of surprises, special guests, great acting and excellent writing. Ron Howard's narration is a bonus. When someone asks me what it's like, I compare it to ""Scrubs"" but less mean spirited and more family values. I hope it represents the beginning of a trend toward great but gentle humor. I'm just about fed up with ""reality"" programs. Thank you very much. Keep up the good work.",Arrested Development,
A retelling of a classic with a fresh perspective,"Fun, hilarious, and overall entertaining. This modern remake has plenty of material that differentiates itself as its own movie. Because of the gender swap, the film is able to retell this story in its own unique way.,The film acknowledges the 1987 version respectfully through some story beats as if to tell the audience that the filmmakers adore the original as well. It is heartwarming, charming, and a hilarious flick for both new audiences and fans of the classic.",Overboard,10
"Fun, fresh comedy","This movie is so fun, light-hearted, and at times a tear-jerker. The new cast lends its authenticity for a new spin on a great premise. I was literally laughing out loud at this movie, it was so refreshing to see a comedy that is ACTUALLY FUNNY! Eugenio Derbez is the perfect lead for this crossover film, and his on-screen chemistry with Anna Faris is undeniable. There's a big emphasis on the familial bond throughout, and the cast feels like a real family unit that learns to love one another. Love it, can't wait to see it again.",Overboard,10
Funniest Show in Television- Brilliant!!,"Annyong (Hello)! I absolutely love this show and so will you!  If you haven't seen it- give it a second week and you will be laughing at all the subtle things and be caught up on the storylines.  I usually tape it and watch it a second time with friends so I can catch the things that I missed the first time around or just because I like to watch it again!  Yes, that is Ron Howard narrating the show.  In an early episode the did make an Opie reference and last week Henry Winkler did a trademark Fonzie move in front of a mirror when they were combing hair.  Don't let FOX cancel another brilliant show!  P.S. Annyong is the Korean boy that Lucille adopted because Buster would not eat his cottage cheese (it might be one of those had to be there to understand)!  His name really is not Annyong- Annyong means Hello in Korean!",Arrested Development,10
writing as complex as DNA,"You know how Pixar movies are sprinkled with growed-up jokes that the kiddies won't get? But there's lots there for kiddies, too?,Arrested Development is like that, except that the episodes are sprinkled with jokes that geniuses will get, but there's lots there for normal people, too. AD is rich with layers that I have missed 3, 4, 5 times only to finally ""get it"" on the 4th, 5th, 6th viewing.,For instance, I can't quite get over how the show is riddled with jokes that depend on stuff that hasn't happened yet. That's absurdly difficult writing. It's like comedy the way God would write it, full of double and triple meanings, palindromic, executed with an masterful awareness of the whole project. It's ridiculous. As a writer myself, AD makes me want to sit in a corner and weep, because I have no hope that I will ever write anything this good, or even this complex.,Sigh.,I'm glad someone else did, though! Great stuff!",Arrested Development,10
Where are the real stars?,"What this movie lacks are REAL STARS. Kurt and Goldie were major stars when the original was made and they had great chemistry, (besides being a real life couple who are the parents of Kate Hudson)., and it showed on-screen. You can imagine the fights and arguments in the movie were so real-like because they had them in real life! All I can say is this is formula PC drivel, with the same ethnic jokes, same cultural differences that we have seen in comedies on tv and movies for years. Nothing new and because the ""stars"" are so forgettable, this remake will probably not be getting played for the next 30 years like the original that has become a comedy classic. When millenials do remakes, it's usually predictable and not really funny. Kind of like the fish taco from the food truck that millennials think is so great, waited an hour in line to get, paid DOUBLE, and the rest of us know it's the same old fish taco, just repackaged and doubled in price. When will the new Hollywood learn, STARS make movies. Original IDEAS are better than rehashed ones. Maybe the CGI is better, but it doesn't carry the movie., STARS and great writing does.",Overboard,3
The shills have arrived!,"I see the shills have arrived en masse with their 10/10 and one or two sentence reviews, to try to pull this dreck up from the murky depths where it rightfully belongs.
This movie is horrible. Possibly the worst remake of a fine classic movie that I have ever seen.
Poor casting, acting, no chemistry, the original stripped of all its charm and replaced with mean spiritedness and spite.,Save your money and watch the original.",Overboard,1
"The Greatest Comedy on TV ""nobody"" saw","I think this was greatly overlooked by the viewing public primarily due to it's layered humour, and self-referencing. In the vein of Seinfeld (but much better), it staged jokes woven within jokes that often had to be caught by the perceptive viewer. Coincidences were fashioned together to great hilarious plot elements and numerous sight gags are incorporated to emphasise the jokes. The narrator carries the story forward and often adds amusing commentary with sarcastic wit.,A must see and highly addictive! If you liked Seinfeld, The Office, Curb your Enthusiasm, you'll love Arrested Development. It will sorely be missed.",Arrested Development,10
Great Comedy Show,"This is a very well written and well acted show. The characters are very well thought out and interact in the best ways possible in order to create priceless comedy. ,I think it's too bad that the type of comedy in this show isn't valued very much by the American public. Here in Europe everybody loves and watches the show. In Great Britain it was a hit. ,I'm still hoping they make another season. Even if they have to find a new producer. Fox just dropped the show, as they do most good TV shows that come to surface. All in all it's worthwhile to buy the show on DVD! Great DVDs to have!",Arrested Development,9
It didn't need to be made but I don't care!,"Overboard was great! It was charming, it had tons of clever humor, and a very sweet story. Anna Faris shines as the main star and Eugenio Derbez is sooooooooooooooooooooo watchable. Check out Overboard when you have the chance, it is great stuff!,An A+ for sure or on iMDB, 10/10!",Overboard,10
Why does everyone hate it so much??,"I thought this was a fun little remake. Yes, I liked the classic original one better but this was so fun. It does not deserve a 4 star rating that's for sure. Hope more people who like it rate it because it was a fun cute little movie.",Overboard,10
Hilarious,This show is extremely funny but not for everyone. It doesn't just tackle hip hop culture it also makes fun of many modern day sociopolitical issues. I would recommend for people who are open minded.,Atlanta,9
Nice... very nice,"During the show's debut in 2003-2004, I would quickly turn off my television set when that ukulele started to strum at the opening credits.,I was dead wrong at what I would eventually envision.,After viewing several episodes, I found this to be a witty, and sometimes delightfully funny program. Droll, hardworking, and recently widowed Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) has to endeavor with his father's (Jeffrey Tambor) imprisonment (in part to his real-estate company trading practices) his pampered mother Lucille (Jessica Walter), twin sister Lindsay, younger brother Byron ""Buster"" Bluth and his out-of-work oldest brother magician GOB. (or George Oscar Bluth II, pronounced ""Jobe""). After George Sr. is sent to prison, the unbearable family members turn to Michael to head the corporation and handle their funds. Through it all, Michael has a son, George Michael, a timid and rather confounded young man who idolizes his daddy, has a mild infatuation with his only cousin, Maeby (Lindsay's daughter), and is in charge of the semi-popular Bluth frozen banana stand at Newport Beach's Balboa Island. ,Not to mention the unexplainable Carl Weathers guest appearances, Ron Howard's uncredited narration, and brother-in-law Tobias' acting attempts, this program deserves its merit.",Arrested Development,
A Trainwreck Worth Watching,"The best way to describe the new Arrested Development season is this: You are all excited about taking a train ride with friends that you haven't seen in nearly 10 years, to somewhere, maybe a vacation of something. After the first hour of the train ride together you realize how slow trains are and start to get bored. By the 4th hour though something changes. Whether it be a loose bolt on the tracks or a penny on the rails, the train begins to crash. Everything is in turmoil, the one exception is your seat. Your one seat seems to be the only constant on this engine of turmoil and destruction. And you can't. Stop. Watching. By the last 3 hours of this you have completely forgotten about the slow and subtly boring start. You remember that in order for their to be a payoff, there has to be a set up. And it's at about this time that you stop panicking about the series being ruined and the 4th season being a failure. You finally get to appreciate all the set ups, all the subtleties, and you hold on for your life as the story comes to it's highest points. When it's over, you are left with a sense of euphoria and just a little bit of ""What the hell just happened"". The best part is that once you finish the season, it isn't over. The first episodes become more in depth and clear and are an entirely new experience to watch. You can basically watch the season twice and have two different experiences. The only constant is you, sitting in the middle of a train wreck, with your eyes widened in horror and delight, and you can't. Stop. Watching",Arrested Development,9
Blehhh,"Just one more shining example that Hollywood has lost its ability to come up with even one original idea. I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and rail against Hollywood's blatant pandering to the PC crowd. That's been pointed out well enough. I'm just going to say that this movie wasn't funny. At all. Pretty sad when you consider they are marketing it as a comedy. Compared to this, the new Ghostbusters was a laugh riot. And that one sucked, too.",Overboard,1
Cant get enough...,"The dialogue, the script, the chemistry of the characters. Amazing. The dynamic of the characters is broad. I feel invested. I actually feel like it's true life. I'm from Baltimore and it reminds me of conversations with friends when I was younger. Darius is seriously my favorite character... everything about the guy. I'm still laughing about the gun shop scene. (dont think that's considered a spoiler),That was my review but they are making me fill more space. Just know that this is my FIRST review.. I think they deserve it.,Not many words here but I rave about this show to everyone.,Here's my 10th line.",Atlanta,10
"Very promising, great acting.","As a long time fan of Glover from Community, his stand up comedy, and even to his rapping (Childish Gambino), I was of course excited to see this show.,As a pale white guy from Ohio, I still found the show to be very enjoyable and with the way they did the first episode, it has a monumental chance to be successful. Darius cracks me up with how he thinks, he's exactly the type of quirky person you need in this type of show (assuming I know how it's going to continue), but he is basically the Daryl of Walking Dead. Everyone will love him and if he ever dies the show may go downhill without him.,Since I've been a fan of Donald since Community I may be a tiny bit biased, but he yet again seems to be a superb actor and I already felt connected to him and wanting him to 'win'.,It's no surprise Donald will turn this into an amazing series because he is a great actor and writer.,Just please don't kill Darius. How will we ever have rat phones if he dies?",Atlanta,9
Some guys don't get all the luck. Here it's funny and entertaining,"Looks like FX has once again found another island in the rough with their new show ""Atlanta"". Creator, Writer and Actor Donald Glover (no relation to actor Danny Glover) is that guy who everything seems to happen to him and/or around him. Featuring a primarily cast of color, Brian Tyree Henry, Keith Stansfield and Zadie Beetz (each established actors) will surely become household names with this series. Like some of my other favorite FX shows (The Americans, AHS, FARGO, You're the Worst), ""Atlanta"" is gritty, in-your-face and realistically captures a slice of life rarely shown on TV. ""Atlanta"" is an adult show about climbing the ranks into the rap scene, and surviving the neighborhood, that shouldn't be missed.",Atlanta,10
Brilliant Comedy.,"Arrested Development is a half-hour comedy that focuses on the Bluth family; a very affluent southern-Californian family who are forced together when their father George (Jeffrey Tambor) is arrested. Michael (Jason Bateman), his son, is ostensibly the protagonist, and he is the only one in the family who is by any definition ""normal"". Michael, a widower, is the only one with a job; he runs the Bluth Company in his father's absence in his own compulsive way, and is constantly thwarted in comedic ways by his family. Michael's older brother Gob (Will Arnett) is a magician - sorry, an ILLUSIONIST, who takes himself very seriously. Unfortunately for him, nobody else does. His botched attempts at performing his illusions are always hilarious, and always preceded by one version or another of the opening melody of Europe's ""The Final Countdown"". Michael's younger brother, Buster (Tony Hale), is a 30-ish mama's boy. He is socially awkward to the point that he fits the profile of a serial killer. Buster has no job, instead going to school after school to pursue various interests as strange and unrelated as Native American drumming and cartography. In the pilot episode he mistakenly identifies the blue area on a world map as the land. Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is Michael's twin sister, an extremely vain, self-centered and sexually frustrated woman whose loveless marriage to Tobias Funke (David Cross), a frequently unemployed ex-psychiatrist/wannabe actor, is precariously balanced, to say the least. Tobias is a ""never-nude"" who wears cut-off jean shorts into the shower. Needless to say, this puts a strain on their sex life, and the couple are never happy; always in one form or another of therapy, or trying an ""open relationship"" and racing to entice members of the opposite sex into trysts that, for one reason or another, never work out. Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walter) is the matriarch of the Bluth family. She is rarely seen without a drink in her hand, and her biting wit and cruel barbs toward her children are doled out relentlessly. She is shrewd and manipulative, Michael has to work hard to stay ahead of the various plots and scams she is always concocting, which usually center around money and keeping her public image up to par. Michael has a son named George Michael (Michael Cera) who is studious and naive. He is wholesome and quite awkward, constantly striving for the approval of his busy father with his intense work ethic, and trying his best to suppress his lust for his cousin, Maeby (Alia Shawkat), the trouble-making daughter of Lindsay and Tobias.,The central plot point in Arrested Development is the imprisonment of George Sr. and the legal and financial problems the company encounters in his absence, but there are always so many subplots that there is something new and engaging happening in every episode. Nothing feels forced, in fact everything feels as if it was planned from the very conception of the show, though there is enough improvisation from the actors, particularly from comedian David Cross, to strongly suggest otherwise.,Arrested Development is, without a doubt, one of the best television shows that has ever aired. Every actor is perfect in his or her role, the dialogue is fantastic, the cameos and guest appearances are well cast and never lack substance. The narration by producer Ron Howard is always excellent and ties the story together expertly. The show is filmed in a natural, mockumentary style, usually with one camera panning from character to character rather than several cuts, in the vein of The Office. There is no annoying canned laughter, and the humor is cutting edge and sophisticated. There is a joke for everyone, nothing is taboo and nothing is wasted.,Despite it's overwhelming popularity, critical praise, and enormous fanbase, Arrested Development was canceled by Fox at the end of its third season, even having to cut it short by several episodes, due to poor ratings. It's cancellation is a testament to how out of touch Hollywood executives are. Everybody Loves Raymond can air for 10 years of formulaic mediocrity, but a show as brilliantly witty, daring, and relevant as Arrested Development can be cancelled after only 3. It's a travesty, and one in which the pain can only be lessened by repeated viewings of the old episodes on DVD. Do yourself a favor and buy the entire collection, it has great replay value and the joy of showing it to people who have never seen it cannot be stressed enough.,This is a superb show, down to the last detail, and deserves every ounce of praise lavished upon it. What are you waiting for? Go and watch it!",Arrested Development,10
Like a Sitcom From God,"Everyone like sitcoms in California. And since Arrested Development is based in California it's already won half the battle. But it still sticks out as quite probably one of the best sitcoms any of us are going to see, right up in the ranks of Seinfeld.,Although unlike Seinfeld, it has a plot. Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is naturally, unfairly put in the position of having to take care of his rather incapable family, as well as his own son, his father's housing business and his own problems. Each episode generally exists around a core conflict between one of the many cast members, either a family member or a family friend. As expected in any great sitcom, story lines weave in and out of episodes and fresh new material is put in to the show. The writers quite simply; extremely good.,Each and every character has their own personality and they feel, look and act real. Every character is just as spicy and well-developed as the next. Even the narrator is as heart-felt as the characters. The conflicts range from your typical comic plots to a few things that just might take you by surprise.,-- One thing that does stand out the fact there is no laughter audio in the background. Something that seems like a really good move and gives the show a distinct, more personal feel. It fits perfect in with the type of humor the series delivers. One more trademark is the re-run value. There are a bunch of things in the episodes, from props to lines that'll take a few viewings to actually notice they were said, making you maintain a level of interest on the show whenever you watch it again.,So all in all, Arrested Development is one of those shows that anyone can enjoy, whether you like this kind of thing or not. . . Not to be missed by anyone.",Arrested Development,9
throughly enjoyable!,"""Overboard"" (PG-13, 1:52) is a romantic comedy which is a remake of the 1987 film starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell and directed by Garry Marshall. The 2018 version is directed by Rob Greenberg (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Leslie Dixon, Bob Fisher and Greenberg. It maintains the same basic plot as the original, but swaps the genders of the two main characters and adds some spice (and a lot of comedic opportunities), by casting a well-known Hispanic actor as the male lead.,Popular and influential Mexican actor-comedian-writer-director-producer Eugenio Derbez stars as Leonardo, a rich and totally self-absorbed Mexican playboy. As his entrepreneur father lay ill back home, the heir apparent to lead his father's company gallivants off of the U.S. Pacific coast on his hugely extravagant yacht (or ""floating orgy"", as his sister calls it). Meanwhile, his sisters, Magdalena (Cecilia Suarez) and Sofia (Mariana Trevino), hold vigil at their father's bedside, the former angling to see how she might become the one to take over her father's company when he dies, and the latter trying to mend fences after a contentious history with her father and make up for lost time, while there is time.,Anna Farris plays Kate, a working-class single mother of three girls. Kate works two jobs (as a pizza delivery driver and a carpet cleaner), while she struggles to pay the bills, raise her kids and finish studying for her nursing exam. She has the emotional support of her friend, Theresa (Eva Longoria), and Theresa's husband, Bobby (Mel Rodriguez), but that only goes so far. Things go from bad to worse when Kate's mother (Swoosie Kurtz) backs out on her commitment to help take care of the girls so she can pursue her dream of acting and then Kate has a run-in with Leonardo while cleaning the carpets on his yacht, he treats her very badly and causes her to get fired. And then... Kate receives an eviction notice.,One night, Leonardo gets drunk, falls off his yacht, washes up on shore and develops amnesia. Seeing his picture in the newspaper (and spurred on by Theresa), Kate shows up at the hospital and claims Leonardo as her husband. It takes some convincing, but Kate gets Leo (as she calls him) to come home with her, get a construction job (working for Bobby) and cook, clean and help take care of the girls so she can devote more time to studying. Leo eventually takes to this life (and even starts to thrive in it), while Kate and her daughters take to him. But what will happen after Kate finally takes her test?,""Overboard"" is thoroughly enjoyable! Farris and Derbez are both great comic actors who make a terrific comic duo - each doing some of their best work to date. Greenberg surrounds them with wonderful characters and gives everyone funny (and sometimes touching) things to say and do. This movie is predictable and not terribly realistic or original, but it sure is entertaining! ""A-""",Overboard,8

I will definitely watch it again and get it the Blu-ray of course!!! Thanks(:",Overboard,8
This show deserves a better review and a lot of love!,"The 1 star review that shows up when I looked this up on IMDb is ridiculous! I watch quite a few shows (way too many) and this one genuinely gets a smile on my face without cheap tricks, fake laughter, annoying punchline tunes trying to convince me what just happened was funny. ,The main characters in this show are already memorable in the pilot, they just have chemistry straight away. A lot of shows that I really love now didn't start off as well as 'New Girl' has for me.,The 'formula' feels fresh to me, I haven't seen this show before in another form and I absolutely love Zoey in this. Her personality in this show is exactly why I fall in love in real life. Just watched the third episode and I'll be sure to tune in next week!",New Girl,
I hate this show,"I have seen the first two episodes, when are the next ones coming?,I watched each episode almost a week apart. Each time I hated it. Each time the show ended it was only like 5 minutes. They show one or two scenes and the show is over. They better have 50 episodes per season to make up for this feeling.,Each time I checked & the runtime was just over 21 minutes so my computer is in on it too. I don't know how the director and producers of this show got my computer in on it but I know their plot. ,There is no way a show goes by this fast and is 21 minutes long!,Oh and the ""main"" character, Glover something, what is the deal with him? Is he a comedian or something. What is he trying to prove. I find myself laughing at the strangest and most uncomfortable situations while thinking of the scene and story at the same time. Why is he making me feel and think about the horrible situation while at the same time being entertaining and funny.",Atlanta,10
"A TV Show unlike anything that is out there right now, Atlanta is captivating, hilarious, and down-to-earth. Donald Glover has created a scintillating show.","Atlanta, created and written by the multi-talented Donald Glover presents an intriguing, dynamic chemistry between an enigmatic Earn Marks (Donald Glover) and the stern, hostile, hood-driven city of Atlanta. A college drop out, Earn Marks seems to be living life at the bottom of a pit; a broke father, estranged by his parents and engaged with an absurd relationship with a girlfriend who mothers his daughter (unclear) - everything seems bleak. However, when news breaks out that his cousin Alfred 'Paper Boi' Miles (Brian Tyree Henry) is now the new hot rapper on the block, Earn drops everything he is doing to pursue the job of being Paper Boi's manager. ,Even after having watched 3 episodes of the TV show, I still find it tough to pinpoint exactly what genre this absurdly riveting series falls under. While it pushes towards the drama section, the show is ridden with comedic bits. From the cinematography, to the acting, to the script, so far I have nothing but praise for Atlanta. Moreover, I cannot understate the rounded quality of the characters, to which I cannot end this short review of Atlanta without mentioning Darius (Keith Stanfield). ,The eccentric nature of Darius is precisely exemplified by the first meeting between Earn and Darius in Episode One (The Big Bang): Darius holding a plate of cookies, wearing a cooking robe and a bandanna, with a knife ready to attack in case of an intruder. Even though he is consistently under the influence of cannabis, from time to time, Darius exudes of intellectual and spiritual wisdom. As in Episode Two (Streets on Lock) when speaking about the violent altercation of the previous night, Darius explains ""As humans we are always close to destruction, life is (selfish) but a series of close calls I mean how would you know if you were alive, unless you are willing to die."",The TV Show Atlanta is an avant-garde in the African-American film industry and seems to be following the same footsteps of top quality shows like Power and How to Get Away With Murder. Donald Glover has created a grabbing story which only begs for more.",Atlanta,9
It's good. Watch it! You won't regret it.,"It's been a long time since a show has been able to suck me in with the pilot. The last show that was able to do that was Monk. Usually when I see a pilot I'm thinking, ""That was okay I guess. But I don't care what happens with them to keep watching."" It was very different with Atlanta. I wanted to see what happened with Earn and Paperboy. I want to keep seeing every week what happens with them. ,It also feels very real. Although there's a lot of humor involved and some things are exaggerated, I feel as if this material was created by someone who experienced these situations first hand. When it comes to showing the Black community on Television it usually feels fake and based on stereotypes. This doesn't feel like that at all. That's what I love the most. ,If you're not watching this you should be. It's funny, the acting is realistic and believable, the writing is great. It's hands down one of the best shows on television.",Atlanta,9
One of the best and therefore often overlooked of recent American sitcoms,"I first saw an episode of Arrested Development after coming back from a few drinks at the pub. It was on at about midnight on BBC 4, perhaps the first time I've ever looked at that channel, and I would never have watched it had I not dropped the remote control in my drunkenness. That was perhaps the first time in my life that I've been grateful for alcohol induced clumsiness.,In the few seconds it took me to pick up the control from the floor I heard a joke that made me laugh so hard that I was hiccoughing for the next fifteen minutes. BBC 4 were showing a double bill of the series and after it finished I went straight onto Amazon and ordered the DVD.,When it arrived I was slightly concerned that, now sober, I would be less than impressed. That was not the case. Instead of a show that appeals to the drunkard in me I found myself watching a programme of such subtlety, ability and humour that I couldn't tear myself away for the four hundred or more minutes of the first series.,Just about everything on offer is incredibly good. The casting and acting is amazing, the dialogue hysterical, the scenarios uproariously funny and the programme's heart, something I've often found missing in some of the more well known American TV shows, is well and truly live and kicking.,Some have suggested that Arrested Development is too clever for its own good and certainly the fact that the BBC have put it on their arts channel late at night suggests that they believed it to be 'above' the comprehension of the masses, but that says a lot more about the snobbery at the BBC than it does about the show.,Looking online suggests that this programme appeals to a broad spectrum of people all of whom can take different things away from it. Rather like the Simpsons there are many levels of humour that come out from repeat viewings with different people. One friend of mine made me look at Gob in a whole new light, one of greater sympathy. Another suggested that Michael, the main character, wasn't nearly as nice as I'd suggested.,I've yet to be convinced of that but the main thing is that two very different people both not only loved the programme but both went out and bought the first series on DVD. If that isn't an example of the show's broad appeal I don't know what is.,Faults in the show are based on the punchability of most of the characters and the frustration that comes from poor Michael's attempts to keep his family and sanity intact, all of which seem to be pulled apart by the very people he's trying to help. However, the fact that the show never feels bitter and seldom makes you hate any particular character is one of Arrested Development's great achievements.,In short, this is one of the best programmes to emerge on television and, alongside Scrubs, represents one of the funniest, cheeriest and most addictive things currently on TV. My only concern is that it seems there is a Series 2 out somewhere which is still many months, even years, away from arriving in England.",Arrested Development,9
Overboard's a hit!!,I loved the first and I love the second as well!!!,Overboard,10
"It's an OK movie, but a great remake. Overall, very good.","I will agree that this remake of the 1987 movie...seems lazy. If you've watched the original you'll notice that this 2018 flick follows the plot tightly close, almost to a fault.,But I kinda like that they did that. Technically, it's like a scene in the movie when Eugenio Derbez who plays Leonardo is making Spaghetti and Meatballs and he does not like the plan taste of store brought sauce, so he switches it up and adds some new flavor to it. ,Switching the genders of the characters was one new flavor. Anna Faris takes Kurt Russell's role as a single parent trying to keep her head afloat and can use some help. Though Russell does the part better, and it would have been just as nice in this day and age to see a single dad doing his thing, the purpse of Faris in the role was to fully make clear the idea of how hard it is for a lower class single parent to get by and how they could use help. ,Meanwhile Derbez does a far better job in Goldie Hawn's role. He's just so convincing as a man from a different world so removed he cannot even compute with working for a living. ,This remake also adds more depth to itself by putting more fine details in the supporting characters. Like given the children in the movie more individual personalities, and the addiction of Eva Longoria who plays Theresa. She character has a counter part in the original, but indeed Longoria adds more flavor to it (with the help of Mel Rodriguez who plays her husband, hilariously).,I love Spaghetti no matter how it's cook, and I have to say this was a worth wild remake. It's strange remaking Overboard because the film, while good, is kinda mediocre and does not seem worthy, but the story itself is worth of an update and I love how they added some spice to it.",Overboard,7
"Light, refreshing comedy","From the first episode, I found New Girl to be my favourite new series. The premise of the show, a girl living with 3 guys and hilarity ensues, is not the most original, nor the most realistic. But I find the characters to be intriguing, so that I keep wanting to return to see what happens next. ,After a few episodes, the characters become more relatable than in the pilot. Jess is totally awkward, and it seems half the time her head is in the clouds, and half the time she's the most down to earth character. Her extroverted nature becomes more manageable as the series develops, so don't let it put you off initially. ,Nick is a 30-something drop out that still lives with a student mindset. He comes up with some creative ways to not spend money. He's portrayed as not living up to his potential, yet his manner draws you in, kind of like a helpless puppy that you find adorable and pitiful at the same time.,Other reviews are fairly down on Schmidt. Yes, initially, he reeks of douche bag. But he's an ex-fat-kid that now overcompensates for his lack of self esteem with douchey mannerisms. Given that, he's a fairly realistic character with a well developed history. His arrogance is always portrayed in a humorous way, and has become my favourite part of the show.,Winston had his 15 minutes of fame and now is dealing with just being a nobody in a big city again. Fair enough, token black guy.,There is a lot of awkward humour in this show - the kind of moments that make you cringe, yet you can't look away, and feel guilty about wanting to laugh. But every episode does make me laugh out loud. There's a touch of light drama, for those that just want a light hearted show that won't make you think too much.,Overall, I think this is a show about nothing. Every episode seems to be a bunch of intertwining events that happen, like in most sitcoms, but this reminds me most of Seinfeld (the ultimate show about nothing), in that there is no ultimate destination that the storyline needs to arrive at - no huge expectations or conclusions being hung on the season finale. It's just humorous interactions, some fairly plain and everyday events, and some totally wacky events. Just a bright, light hearted show, to be enjoyed for what it is.",New Girl,9
Surprisingly Great,"Contrary to my expectations, this is not the Zooey Deschanel show. Because that is what I thought it would be when my friend told me about it. I mean, the premise of this show is that she - Zooey Deschanel - plays a bubbly, quirky-but-cute girl who moves into an all-guys apartment. Now, that's the same character she plays in every film and every series she's ever been in. It's also the same persona she uses when she sings in her band, or gives interviews, or (I imagine) blogs about baking Dr. Seuss-themed cupcakes for a company of lumberjacks.,Don't get me wrong - it works. For me. On so many levels. But the problem is that she is just so aware of it. She's a dazzling indie girl with a brain and a body, and my god does she know it. So a show completely focusing on that would be unbearable.,But surprisingly, this show isn't about that at all. It isn't even really about her character that much. Most of the comedy comes from the male characters, who are played by non-famous and extremely talented actors, and who find themselves in situations which as funny as they are fresh and relatable. ,So, to reiterate, this is not a show about Zooey Deschanel. This is a show about life as a twenty-something in the twenty-first century. It's Friends except not set or made in the nineties. It's great and it makes me laugh a lot. And I highly recommend it.",New Girl,9
amazing show,"A huge TV buff, I made an account just to start reviewing after I watched this show. It is all around perfect. It's a dry humor, with very witty writing- but has me laughing all the way through. It's a bit awkward when things get serious, but the serious parts are strongly acted and are very deep and moving. ,I go from laughing hysterically one minute to teary eyed the next. ,Atlanta is all around one of the best shows I've ever watched. Donald Glover strongly grasps the raw emotion of mental illness, family relationships, and what it's like living in Atlanta.,This show can relate to all people, and is presented to show others the perspective of a young black man trying to make it in Atlantas rap scene.",Atlanta,10
The Battle's In The Writing,"A TV show can consist of 5 individuals sat in a room & as long as it's well written it can work. Atlanta isn't set in a room, but it does work because it is well written. The battle has already been won.,The writing doesn't alienate or ask too much of the viewer, rather it effortlessly lulls you along. There is an intentional dream-like quality to the writing that elevates it from the world in which it is set, ergo adds a magic unseen which sets us up to believe.,I realise I'm making a ballyhoo about the writing, but it really is that good. They've managed to hit the sweet-spot. Good writing is hard to come by these days & its lack of presence is often masked with visual or audio trickery. Well done to those involved.,The acting is good, the characters have an authenticity that is relatable & I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the series.",Atlanta,8
Cancellation the worst decision FOX made,"Furthermore, an even worse decision was show writer Mr. H's refusal to stay on so that the show could be picked up by Showtime. I was willing to buy Showtime just for this show. This show was a breath of fresh air among cookie-cutter sitcoms, mind numbing reality shows and overdone law/medical/forensics shows. Who are these people with the Neilson boxes and what are they thinking? How many Law & Order and CSI spin-offs/ clones are they going to make? I hated the originals! Reality shows lower your IQ by two points with each episode, and very few sitcoms are truly funny or original anymore. This was one of the few. The writing, direction, production, acting, and every aspect down to the music and camera-work were all top notch. Despite FOX's lack of advertising, this show won 6 Emmys on its first season. I didn't even know about the show until Season 2 was out on DVD. I bought Season 1 based on word of mouth (and immediately went out and purchased Season 2 after watching only four episodes of Season 1). I wondered how I had not heard about such a brilliant show through 2 whole seasons. It was as if FOX wanted it to fail. I learned FOX kept cutting the seasons short and bounced its scheduling around putting it in the line up against other networks power shows- it even put it up against Monday Night Football- then wondered why the ratings were poor? This show was destined to be another 'Cheers', a show that had poor ratings during its first seasons then went on to become one of the longest running hits of all times. It makes me want to cry that such a truly genius show won't continue. I purchased Season 3 on DVD and watched the entire two-disk set, all the extras and episodes with commentaries a second time in one sitting. This show is that good! The clerk at the store from which I purchased the DVD even commented on what a smart purchase I was making, and then we discussed how saddened we were that it was canceled. I pray DVD sales will force FOX or Mr. H to reconsider, and if there is a God, he will bring this show back from the dead.",Arrested Development,10
really is as good as everyone says,"Few things are funnier than really smart people acting really silly, and that pretty describes everyone involved with Arrested Development, from the cast and writers down to the cameramen and editors. It's a show that contains some very witty, complicated and obscure humor but also gleefully dives into slapstick, goofy visual gags and general absurdity. Rather than feeling like a clash of different comedic styles however, the different elements mesh into a completely unique brand of humor. It may take a few episodes for you to get into the tone of the show and learn the quirks of all the individual characters but once you do the laughs are pretty much nonstop.,Speaking of the characters, they are by far the best thing about the show. The whole cast is great, and they all work together flawlessly. If I had to choose a favorite it would be Jessica Walter as the mom, Lucille Bluth. Every line she says is clipped with the perfect degree of icy rudeness. She's crude and manipulative, but she manages to see herself as classy and victimized. One of my favorite lines in the whole series is when GOB is tackled for bringing bees into the prison and she pointlessly chides him ""They don't allow you to bring bees in here."" It's a throwaway line that could easily have been cut from the script but it suits her character so perfectly (it's such a heartless and useless thing to say) that it becomes laugh out loud hilarious.,I also love the performances of Will Arnett as the macho and aggressive but very very needy GOB Bluth, Tony Hale as the weird and lovable yet creepy younger brother Buster and young Michael Cera as the nervous goody-two-shoes teenager George-Michael (one of the best teenage actors I've ever seen). The other actors are all great too, those are just the ones that stand out most to me. And of course Jason Bateman has the most screen time and holds everything together perfectly as the most normal family member, Michael Bluth.,I could go on for pages about how much I love this show. I'll just end by saying, if you're going to start watching it be prepared to watch all 3 seasons because you probably won't be able to stop. With so many people touting Arrested Development as ""the best show ever"" it's tempting to say that it's overrated. But the more I think about it, the more I really don't think it is overrated, because in all honesty nothing else that I've seen is this good.",Arrested Development,10
Could Well Lay Claims To Being the Greatest Comedy Series Ever Made,"When I first started watching AD I just thought it was very funny, but about halfway through the second season I realized I was seeing something of exceptional quality. It was more than just funny; it was so wonderfully crafted on every level. Here're my reasons for why it could legitimately be argued that this was the greatest comedy series to ever air.,-EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER WAS IDEALLY CAST.,It would be stating the obvious to say that the writing was great. We already know that. But the characters just wouldn't have been the same had they been played any other way. Just imagine Gob or Tobias played by other actors and you see right away what I mean. And if you go back and look at the pilot, you'll see that David Cross had the character nailed right from his first scene. On the other hand, other actors grew into their roles. Maeby changed the most throughout the series, and it was a pleasure to watch her evolve. And George, Sr and Oscar were each such well-defined characters that at times I found myself forgetting they were both played by the same person.,-STORY WAS PUT FIRST OVER GIMMICKS ,Whereas most sitcoms are built around some sort of premise designed to stand out, the focus of AD was just its continuing story and characters. AD feels like an entirely different planet from Friends or Everybody Loves Raymond where plot points were designed to be as simple for the audience to grasp as possible and the focus was more ""How do we keep the audience from thinking hard for 22 minutes?"" AD on the other hand rewarded the audience for paying attention and gave them something to follow. Sadly, this resulted in the show having a hard time finding an audience, since you would miss a lot of references if you just watched an episode mid-season.,-CREATIVE USE OF THE FORMAT ,Of course substance is more important than style, but it's always nice to have style and do creative things. AD went the extra step. Another show, such as The Office, would be content to just use a mockumentary technique. AD pushed the mockumentary device further to creatively use cutaways, flashbacks, archival footage, website screenshots, self-reference, and clever ideas like the ""On the Next"" segment. Tons of other shows, from Sex and the City to Scrubs, use voice-over narration, but AD used its narrator in the most creative ways imaginable, providing a commentary that is itself tongue-in-cheek. The show took on a life of its own and seemed to always be playing with its audience.,-CREATIVE USE OF GUEST STARS ,AD built a pretty impressive roster of guest stars over just three seasons, but it never felt like the show was resorting to gimmicks. The guest stars played characters suited to them or that advanced the story instead of just being the guest of the week. Again, totally different from Friends or Will and Grace where you would have ""the Brad Pitt episode"" or ""the Matt Damon episode,"" etc.,-FOCUS ON TOPICAL ISSUES WITHOUT REALLY BEING ABOUT THEM ,I love how the show made so many references to Iraq and the war, yet never actually made any commentary on it. In that sense, it was a bit like MASH; building absurd situations about an absurd issue and lets it stand for itself. I also don't think there's been another sitcom in which the characters actually travel to Iraq, as the gang does in ""Exit Strategy."" That episode made me go: ""Dang, this show has balls."",-PRESENTING Risqué MATERIAL IN NOT-SO-OFFENSIVE WAYS ,The defining episode that made me first realize I was watching a truly great show was ""Sad Sack,"" which has the funniest twist ending I could ever have imagined (it's what the title refers to). Yet the joke was done in a way that you actually bought it and accepted it within the terms of the show's reality. South Park would have done the same joke very differently. A lesser show would not have been able to pull it off at all. Overall, it was similar building of the characters and attention on the details of each storyline that allowed the audience to accept the show's crazy situations as being plausible.,-FAST-PACED HUMOR, CUTAWAY JOKES, SIGHT GAGS, POP CULTURE REFERENCES,Many reviews I've read of The Simpsons (and to a lesser extent Family Guy) point out these attributes as well. But those reviews also point out that it was due to being animated that those shows could do it so well and get away with it. Well, here's a live-action show that did it equally well.,-CINEMATIC FEEL ,Almost every episode had enough material to have been movie. I'll admit that not every episode is great, but there was an overall consistency throughout the three seasons. One of the very best episodes in my opinion was ""Meat the Veals."" The climax of that episode alone felt like the climax of a big action comedy feature. It was hard to believe that a mere sitcom went to such lengths. And it wasn't even a season finale.,and, above all else...,-IT WAS FUNNY! ,The humor was often tongue-in-cheek. The jokes were well-planned in advance. The whole thing was self-referential and post-modern, in a style similar to St. Elsewhere, except that was a drama. In such a short run, AD was able to find its voice.,And that is that!",Arrested Development,10
Not to miss !!,"Even though this movie was a remake it realy has its own identity the movie was funny , nice , and fun to watch . ,I realy loved it and its definitely a movie that you shouldn't miss !!",Overboard,10
Very Cute,"It was cute and funny! This is not an Emmy award movie so take it as it is, a cute remake of a great movie.",Overboard,9
Probably one of the funniest series,"I think it is a very good show. It's been a while since I laughed that hard. I'd like to address a lot of the other reviews saying that it is not funny and unrealistic.,I feel that people rating this show badly have just been formatted by all the other series and movies. They are expecting a deep story and realism... I think they may have been mislead by Zooey Deschanel thinking it was going to be a lot more mature. It doesn't differ much from the big bang theory or How I Met your Mother in term of style. If anything it is better. But I don't see how you can not appreciate these characters. Saying they are unrealistic is like saying the ocean is full of water... It's a comedy TV show, not real life. So it's not a valid point in my opinion.,You should take it for what it is. They are very caricatured characters but it doesn't stop you from getting attached to their unique personality. I hope people don't get discouraged from giving it a chance because of the low reviews.",New Girl,10
Great Show!!!,"I really enjoy this show so far, only 3 episodes in, I can't believe the bad reviews people are giving it. Jess(Zooey) is so endearing and funny, some people are saying it's same show different actors, but really what show is this like? It's similar to three's company from 30 years ago. I really hope this show makes it, Zooey Deschanel is perfect for this character. This is the first review I've written, I check out a lot of shows but I really only enjoy a few and this is one. I was just appalled at what people were saying about this show. Sure I could take or leave the other guys in the show but maybe with time they will grow on you. Nick isn't so bad.",New Girl,
Welcome to Atlanta,"As a fan of the rap/Hip hop culture, I've already been introduced to Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino. Just seeing him in the preview for this show got me excited. The show is centered around a young man named Alfred 'paper boy' miles and his cousin Earn Marks. Alfred is an up and coming rapper from Atlanta that just released his first mix-tape and his cousin,earn, see's he has potential. Being in the financial crisis he is, and having his knowledge, Earn sees an opportunity to make himself some money as 'paper boy's' manager, all the while trying to get his cousin to the big leagues. As a show created by a rapper, about the rap scene, i don't see anywhere the show could go wrong.",Atlanta,10
Accurate dapiction of Youth and Hip-Hop Culture in Atlanta,"As and Atlanta native I fell in love with the show's ability to depict Atlanta's youth and hip-hop culture with slang words like ""Fye"" ""Fire"" and ""Lit"" as well as the show's ability to comment on social issues in the city with a unique sense of humor.",Atlanta,10
Nothing else like it,"It's shockingly real, hilariously sad, terrifyingly and I can't get enough. Paper Boi, Darius, Van and Earn are so real it hurts. Season 2 has truly tested every boundary. Genius In every scene. I watch and rewatch, just gets better",Atlanta,10
Hilarious and well-executed show.,"This is, without a doubt, the greatest TV comedy in capturing the 2000s. It mocks the paranoia surrounding the Iraq War, the 24-hour news cycle, the housing boom and bust, and the cult of reality television without missing a beat.,It does all of that without ever seeming preachy or losing its charming sense of humor. There is no scene in the series that lacks the self- referential humor that characterizes the show, and almost every episode builds on the quirks of either one of the main characters or one of the many background characters of Orange County. Jason Bateman (Michael) does a solid job, but the real stars are the other members of the family. Michael Cera (George Michael), David Cross (Tobias Fünke), and Jessica Walter (Lucille) are particularly memorable.,I will never look at a seal, model homes, or Southern California itself without thinking about the wonderfully dysfunctional Bluths and the time that I spent watching them on ""Arrested Development."",(I have seen this show several times over the years, but I have mostly recently watched in its entirety in June 2017)",Arrested Development,10
Best Comedy of ALL TIME,"Hands down best comedy of all time. Shame on FOX for canceling it! However, they at least released all 3 seasons of DVD! Maybe sales of the DVD will show FOX that they made a huge mistake. Perhaps a Family Guy-esquire revival will be in the works!? After, they did cancel Family Guy....only to bring it back after soared in DVD sales. We should all keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best. The writers did such a fantastic job portraying the Bluth family. And the documentary-style filming was perfect for the atmosphere of the show. The show was witty and addicting. I'll probably be hooked for life. I don't think I've ever laughed so much.",Arrested Development,10
Ummmm.,"Hollywood is really running out of ideas. This really should not have happened. There are certain movies you don't remake for one reason or another, and this is one.",Overboard,1
Kinda cute,"Movie Review Mom Grade: B,
In a Nutshell: It has been many years since I saw the original Gary Marshall movie Overboard starring Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, but I remember thinking it was a charming Rom-com. ,The good news is that there is some charm to this remake, but the bad news is that it's not a great movie.,There is a funny running gag about Mexican soap operas. Now that I think of it, the movie kind of feels like a goofy 1980's Mexican soap opera.
 ,Tips for parents: 
Eugenio Derbez pulls part of his shorts down to reveal a tattoo on his butt cheek.
There is a LOT of Spanish spoken, so there are a LOT of subtitles. If you speak Spanish, you'll hear some profanity.
The plot of the movie is that the protagonist and her children lie to a rich man to take advantage of his amnesia, as well as get a little revenge. Not exactly the kind of example we want to set for our kids.
Girls in bikinis.
Some profanity in English and Spanish.
Alcohol.
There is some discussion about what the word ""pervert"" means, so your young kids are probably going to ask you about it.
You see an unmarried couple in bed together.,Uplifting theme: 
Follow your dream
Motherhood
Poetic justice
""Life's short and you don't want to live with regrets."" - (Anna Faris), ,
Things I liked:
Eugenio Derbez is always delightful. I first saw him in How To Be A Latin Lover. He's super popular in Mexico. I can see why.
Anna Faris is probably best known for her roles in the Scary Movie franchise. Unlike her ex-husband Chris Pratt, she tends to choose movie scripts that end up bombing at the box office. She's extremely likable and capable, although her plastic surgery is a bit distracting. I'm not talking about her breast implants, but it looks like she had something done to her lips. I keep staring at her face to see if I could figure out what she had done.
Fans of The Last Man on Earth: Season 1 will get a kick out of seeing Mel Rodriguez.
Keep watching when the rolling credits run at the end of the movie.
My twin sister teaches nursing students, so I thought it was cute that Anna Faris' character listened to nursing audio books in the car to help her prepare for her big test. Every summer, my sister takes nursing students to various Third World countries to offer free health clinics. The program is run through International Service Learning. I got to go with her one year as a Spanish translator when she went to Colombia. It was awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone in the health industry who is up for a meaningful adventure abroad! 
There is a cute Jaws reference when you see the name tag ""Brody"" on a guy during a conversation about sharks. Ha ha
In a movie filled with wacky gags and slapstick humor, I thought it was insightful to include a short, yet deep scene where some men talked about how they felt like they were just a paycheck to their wives. 
The youngest daughter, played by Payton Lepinski, is so adorable. I'd like to see her in more films.
It's always good to see Eva Longoria.
Director and writer Rob Greenberg was trying to bring something fresh to the remake by switching the gender roles and adding a Latino element to the story.,Things I didn't like:
The chemistry between Eugenio Derbez and Anna Faris isn't very convincing. Of course, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell were an actual couple when they filmed the original Overboard, so their chemistry was undeniable. 
Eugenio wears a lot of Seattle Seahawks t-shirts in the movie, but the location is supposedly somewhere along the Oregon coast. I was just in Seattle last weekend, by the way. It was my very first time there and I was so impressed! My husband and I enjoyed perfect weather with blue skies and had so much fun going on tours, seeing the sites, and discovering cool restaurants. I highly recommend the ""Underground Tour"", ""Free Walking Tours"", and Amazon headquarters tour! What a cool city.,
Interesting lines:
""I don't have time for fun."" - Kate (Anna Faris)
""Then you're not doing it right."" - Theresa (Eva Longoria)
""Land of the free, not land of the free lunch."" - Bobby (Mel Rodriguez)
""Mos of us only know the world we're born into."" - Colin (John Hannah) 
""Act like a man!"" - Godfather",Overboard,6
what the..??,"what is going on in the heads of the people writing such bad reviews of this lovely little show? ,I have to say as many of the others, this show is like a breath of fresh air, there are some great comedies out there these days like Modern family and HIMYM, but this one is a bit different.. it's sweet and endearing, a bit like Friends. And I'm laughing my ass of over every episode. Zooey does a great job here like usually, and I like the rest of the cast as well. The first couple of episodes were a little slow to start but the show has really found it's footing now. I really recommend it!",New Girl,9
Brilliance,"Not so much a laugh out loud show, more of an intelligent social commentary made with a lot of humour. Having said that though, I accidentally ingested something green and edible and the B.A.N episode (aka Donaghue) was one of the funniest things that I have ever seen it my life. I'm still not sure what happened.,100% recommended. Brilliant TV.",Atlanta,10
"Good show, although it didn't quite hold onto me","This is a very well written, well-acted show, and Donald Glover is absolutely phenomenal as its lead. It's a show with many great moments.,It's not, however, a series I plan to keep watching. In part, it's because there's too much quality television nowadays, making me insanely choosy. In part, it's because as I age I become increasingly mindless and more and more spend my times watching action shows like The Strain over intelligent dramas like Rectify. In part, it's because it falls somewhere in between shows which reflect my experience and shows that are so far outside my experience that I find them intriguingly alien, so that it's neither familiar nor unfamiliar enough to hit that sweet spot.,If I watched more, I could probably really get into this, but as I say, there's a lot of competition for my limited viewing time. But I'd say everyone should take a look at this one.",Atlanta,8
Atlanta (S1) - not at all what I expected.,"I really hate hype and I really hate big claims. This show, when it aired the fall of 2016, was pretty much hyped to death and regarded itself as ""Twin Peaks for rappers"". So like any sensible person, I waited until things cooled off before I decided to dive into it. The distance really helped me watch the show for what it, at least from the first season, is - a very offbeat show that deals less with plot and more with the mundanities of life than I would have expected from it, nor would I have ever wanted.,The flurry of 10 star ratings is no doubt coming from Donald Glover super-fans, and I really don't think this show would be successful if he had nothing to do with it. When watching it I had to ask myself that question, ""Would I even be sitting through this is if it weren't for Glover?"" The answer, was leaning on the ""No"" side, and I know I am not alone.,The show has is a simple enough premise but really leaves a lot to be desired regarding plot and character development. The tagline states it's a show about ""Two cousins, with different views on art versus commerce, on their way up through the Atlanta rap scene."" Nothing of the sort ever occurs. They don't talk about art vs. commerce at all. It boils down to Donald Glover's character playing the manager of his ""gangsta rap"" cousin Alfred ""Paper Boy"" Miles, and on occasion Glover's ""Earn"" will tell Paper Boy they need to make more money. That's it.,I was really expecting some kind of struggle between the two artistically, I was expecting some kind of discussion over what type of sound is appropriate, what type of promotion is lucrative, and whether or not taking such routes were worth the trouble -- regular musical-biopic-style concerns. But Glover, for better or worse, just cannot ever play it mainstream so he chooses to chase around vague ideas of poorly written parenthood (For two parents of a toddler, Earn and Vanessa seem to be incredibly available to live their lives without their child), ham-fisted ""deep"" ideas about violence (the scene at the shooting range where one of the protagonists decides to shoot at a target of a dog as some kind of social commentary on shooting targets that look like people.... I have to ask, have any of the writers ever even been to a shooting range? People don't just take their ear-protection off and start arguments, nor would a range owner ever take a shotgun and point it at an alleged troublemaker to scare them out of the store. The audience deserves better writing than this), and surreal just to be surreal moments (A mysterious man giving contrived, overly cryptic pseudo-philosophical advice to Glover, a showy rapper who literally drives an invisible car, black Justin Bieber, etc),What you get out of this amalgamation of attempts at a David Lynch-esque TV series is a show that doesn't exactly know what to make of itself and doesn't seem too concerned with any fluid style or plot. A very strange attempt at a TV series, but not necessarily a miss either.,For instance, one episode will be about Vanessa losing her job as a school teacher because she smoked weed the night before with an almost overbearingly shallow Instagram whore (yeah, incredibly deep characterizations at play again), only to have the next episode be a series of fake commercials and segments for a parody of the BET network (which, as you'll see from the ratings, is easily the most favourable in the first season). The chaotic shift in tone happens all throughout the show and leaves the viewer with a disorienting lack of reference. With a show that has this much disregard for structure, you wonder if Donald Glover & co should have just made a sketch series where they can try out many different ideas at a faster pace than a drawn out dramedy that really at the end of the day goes from ""Earn is Paper Boy's manager"" to ""Paper Boy might have a gig somewhere outside Atlanta"" with absolutely nothing in-between. ,It almost makes the show frustrating to watch. While I don't fault ""Atlanta"" for taking risks and trying to be experimental, it absolutely does not live up to ""Joel and Ethan Coen make a show about hip-hop"".,When ""Atlanta"" works, it's very much a quirky piece of unexpected mundanity and when it doesn't, it just comes across as half-baked and needlessly vague. It's the kind of show that probably wouldn't have this high a rating, never would be given a second season, and wouldn't ever have been given a chance to begin with if it weren't for Donald Glover's existing success and very big claims from the beginning. Users who rate shows based on seeing only one episode really do other potential viewers a disservice. Rate it episode per episode, then rate the show once the season is done. It's that kind of patience that helps kill the misleading energy of hype.,However, it's also the kind of show that will definitely get better in the following seasons as it develops more of a distinct personality and flavor for the viewer to appreciate. Unfortunately that's not going to happen until 2018 so here's for hoping it comes back and actually starts to live up to its promises and claims by auteur Donald Glover. As much as I thought it could use improvement after the first season, I certainly would love to see it succeed in the years following.",Atlanta,6
Finally a Series with some intelligent jokes,"Now most of todays TV-shows are sitcoms, where the jokes 99 of a 100 times are cheap, cheap as ****.,The show is about 3 guys who let a girl move in and live them, which probably warns a lot of people that i think would like this show to not see this show.,But what it is about and what they do is far from anything important in a Comedy TV-Series.,The bottom line is, that this show has intelligent humor and another important ingredient is that the creators are spot on which characters that should have the most airtime.",New Girl,8
New Girl......refreshing at some times...desperate at others.,"okay...another sitcom.....let's try I thought.23 minutes doesn't hurt...and after watching a full season...my impression of the show changed!! So this is the story abt a girl who lives on rainbows and rides unicorns,story of Jessica Day.The central character of the show has to be a fabulous actor,and the creators got that right...Zooey Deschanel does full justice to her role and is nothing the TV world has ever seen before,she comes like a breath of fresh air that passes after a few episodes,she herself does fine buy the world around her crumbles!! We have supporting actors as Schmidt,Nick,Winston and Cece....,I have seen many sitcom like two and a half men and FRIENDS....and after watching a whole season you are left with iron clad impressions about the characters like Charlie is a drunk sex-addict,Alan is a gold digger Chandler is funny and phoebe is weird.Well Except for Zooey,i don't have any such impressions about any of the characters after watching 20-odd episodes.,SCHMIDT-After Jess, Schmidt is the only decently thought out character,i say decent not good,good enough that you can write 5 lines for your homework.He has acted well throughout,and has been given enough scope for the same.,NICK-He seems to be the troubled one of the group and the underdog ,law school dropout and a pathetic bartender.He has been shown crying and drinking a lot while talking to his ex girlfriend,but in normal life he has been shown as most emotionally stunted and sober....clearly his personality is hazy as there is no link between drunk and non-drunk state.Alcohol heightens normal tendencies,it doesn't change ur DNA and make you a mutant.He doesn't have much scope of acting and hasn't made full use of whatever given to him.Seems un-natural and not at ease at times.I still cant make a STATEMENT about nick.,WINSTON-minimum scope of acting among guys,does a decent job but still isn't memorable.Just a normal guy,nothing special.,Cece-She is HOTT!!!....and soon after u think that,you don't see her in rest of the episode.She has done a decent job acting and successfully poses as a strong ally and the only girlfriend for Jess but as her character started to take shape towards the end of the season,and Schmidt realizes there is more to her than a 'hot girl i'm having sex with',when she meets her old relative and shows a family oriented side of her character,after some episodes Schmidt reads a message on her cell indicating her sexual involvement with another man.So the creators ruined her image as well,and left people thinking what her true nature is!!,FACTUAL ERROR....in 4th or 5th episode Jess has trouble saying the word pen*s,due to her immature and childish character.Creators probably forgot that she said the same word sitting by a bar in the 1st episode itself. ...also it has been showed that she used to live with her boyfriend Spencer before she moved in with the guys in 2nd episode,but in another episode its said that she used to live with Cece and she got bored of living with models that's why she moved....maybe we have twins....that would spice up the plot :P,As it is clear most characters lack a good personality because of which i don't see this show making a lasting impression on the TV world,nor do i expect this to go on for more than 3-4 seasons.It gets pretty clear that the writers are struggling and picking up random stuff to make episodes,they will run out of ideas pretty soon.This show despite of Zooey's charm and few thing's here and there about additional characters,does need something dramatic to survive.First 3-4 episodes are magical....straight downhill from there.!!",New Girl,
"Good start, bad standard.","I found the first four episodes of the series to be interesting and rich in originality. However after the fourth episode the quality seemed to take a sudden downward plunge.,The main character Earn and his cousin Paperboy are both easily irritable and put in too much effort to separate from the flock, however they both end up in a typical edgy hipster stereotype. They are on their own very dull characters, but in the first four episodes they are encountered with peculiar characters and events, while the last six episodes of the first season can be described as normal people experiencing normal things.",Atlanta,6
"A Wonderful, Creative, Funny and Smart Masterpiece","Wow, just wow. This was one of the most amazing TV shows i've ever seen. Just the way it's written and the acting is absolutely top class. The show gives you this amazing vibe you just wish you could hold on to. And when your finished the whole season if leaves you wondering what you'll do now with your life . The characters were very well developed, and the idea was amazing. ,There are 10 episodes in the season, which are all around 25 minutes, so it's very short but each episode tells a very unique story. The first episode blew my mind away, it was like a scrambled riddle that you've been spending years trying to figure out only to realize that the answer has been right in front of you the whole time. ,One of the main reasons I love this show is because of the characters, each one brings something to the screen, without them it would be like missing a piece of your life. Together they construct this group that no other show has ever shown me. ,I'd love to thank the writer of Atlanta, cause you really just blew my mind away. You guys created your own world in your own way, but I got to admit after watching episode 7; B.A.N, I was really confused, I thought maybe I was high, but I realized that it was the creativity of Donald Glover/Childish Gambino (my favorite rapper of this century). I mean that guy is so freaking talented.,This isn't a show about getting to the top of the rap game, even though that's what the trailer led me to believe. It's a very creative smart funny humorous series that your wishing it was your first time watching it again.,Also I'm the 7000 person to rate this on IMDb :)",Atlanta,10
"I liked it, and I'm open to coming to love it","Created by and starring Donald Glover (who also directed 2 episodes) I wasn't quite as blown away as most of the critics were. (I think I was over-hyped by the time I watched) but I certainly liked it. For me, the 1st season was pretty uneven from episode to episode, but the stronger episodes are terrific. ,It's got more of an old style sitcom approach in terms of structure (not at all tone!); the focus week to week isn't on a big serialized overall story. Each episode has it's own self contained tale within the larger basic set up. Personally, I generally like longer story arcs better even in dramady (e.g. Transparent, etc), but the show is so fresh, odd and creative in other ways that it helps balance out that drawback. ,Often very funny and sometimes much larger than life, it also has moments of real emotion and subtlety. The acting is strong all around, and it's a world we haven't seen much before – struggling working class African-Americans friends in their mid/late 20s who are not the tough street kids and dealers from the hood we've seen so many times, but who certainly aren't safe and middle-class either. There are guns and drugs but also jobs and kids and record deals. There's real violence but a lot more threatened violence and posturing. And all the characters and relationships are complicated and multi-leveled. ,Glover in particular creates a wonderful protagonist in Earnest. Super smart, open hearted, extremely witty, dead-pan, ambitious but also vulnerable, emotionally confused and a little lost. He's hard not to love and to occasionally be frustrated by (in a good way). ,When the story of the week gives the show enough meat to build 30 minutes on, it can be great. When the story is thin, more of a one line joke, the episode tends to feel thin too, sometimes starting to feel padded and/or straining for humor. ,But it's an impressive start, when it works it successfully combines social satire and comedy with real feelings and surreal story touches, and feels like one of those shows that has room to grow and deepen in future seasons.",Atlanta,
"Funny, intelligent, amazing.","New Girl is the type of series that you won't want to stop watching. IT will certainly put you in a good mood and you'll find yourself laughing while watching it.,The characters are incredibly well-written, each one of them having a back story that is easy to keep up with and very believable. It doesn't take long for us to feel like we're also living in this apartment where Jess moves in after being cheated on by her boyfriend. Soon enough, you'll be feeling like these characters are your friends too and you know them well. Each one of them has their particularities; they all have different personalities and obsessions that make them unique and set them apart from each other.,The fact that there's some plot development throughout the series makes it an interesting show to actually follow and not just watch once in a while. We also see some character development, changes in the characters' personalities that make us either proud or disappointed. ,Truth is, there's no chance this show won't leave a mark on you. It's funny, but still intelligent. It's not some dumb show that simply aims at making the viewer laugh. The jokes are not corny and the events are not random. This is one comedy show like no other: The characters are not stereotyped, and the storyline is not typical and easily foreseeable. ,Give this show a chance. You won't regret it.",New Girl,7
Addicting Show!,"I saw a trailer for this show when it first aired and I thought it looked ""cute"" but not super interesting. I WAS SO WRONG. This show is spectacular. The humor is unbelievable. I really hate stupid awkward moments that make people uncomfortable, but the awkward moments in this show are so laughable it makes it so funny to watch. Each character has their own crazy personality. The characters remind me of The Big Bang Theory characters, each one is super important, has their own humor, and the chemistry is fantastic. I like how they make it OK to be adults in their 30s and not have their entire lives figured out and it's really relatable to a wide category of viewers. the main character Jess is adorable, hilarious, and so likable. Its great fun and super entertaining and you'll surely laugh out loud.",New Girl,10
Entertaining on so many levels,"The script keeps you guessing not just between episodes, but inside of each show. One minute you are laughing, the next trying to figure out where the characters are going next. Definetly sit down with a mind ready to be expanded. ,While I don't relate to the culture depicted, Donald Glover does an amazing job at placing you inside each characters mind.,Don't know if it makes we want to travel to Atlanta (there is a Georgia tourism apple at the end of some shows I noticed), but wouldn't mind getting some of the food shipped. ,Theodore Perkins and the cut out of Drake marked my favorite guest stars. ,Paper Boi and Darrius are great complements to Earn. The dynamic feels real and just hoping they all aren't too famous and busy to give us a Season 3.",Atlanta,10
"It maybe a review for Season 2, but Season 1 was as good as this","I am not sure if I had put in a review for the first season of the show which I why I feel necessary to start off with the fact it was absolutely brilliant and I considered a 9 out of 10 and re-binged just when season 2 started off.,I would like to keep my review of Atlanta S2 very much like the season itself: short and to the point. It is crisp with humor and subtle parodic representation of the world and somehow manages to squeeze great moments like 'Alligator Man', 'Money Bag Shawty', 'Barbershop' (It was ridiculous and almost made snap and laugh simulataneously), 'Teddy Perkins' and 'FUBU'( Special episdoe of sorts where the general storytelling is shifted differently; Like it was for 'B.A.N' back in season 1). And as the season ended with 'Crabs in A Barrel', we got throwback references and a look at how far The paerboi crew have come and reaffirm their loyalties (which means stuff gon be alright for S3, at least as much as it can be in the Glover Brother & co. direction of the narrative ;p).
I really liked Hiro Murai's direction in the season, all more buoyed by the 'This Is America' official vidoe by Don Glove (Sounds like One Piece manga character; I can only hope someone drops into Eiichiro Oda's ears) which so much fun and felt like it was cut out of some Atlanta dream clip scene for Earn himself. The main cast is very good, spotlight on Zazie Beetz for landing Domino in Deadpool 2 and nailing the humor in it and Brian Tyree Henry who is actually a soulful siinger who attended Yale Drama School and sang 'We Can Always Come Back To This' in the tear-jerking TV show This Is Us. Darius is Darius is Darius (I know the actor has a name, is a succesful rapper but Darius, ya know). I would like to end with kudos to the writers for portraying so many social commentaries in an enjoyable and tactful manner and I look forward to the next season from your pens to our screens.",Atlanta,9
Just a bunch of people doing weird stuff for no reason,"This show is full with the most unrealistic and unrelatable characters I've seen. none of them makes any sense, and they do weird stuff just because the writers think weird is funny.,Zoey, is pretty and cute, and doing the all awkwardness thing. but she is not awkward in the way you can relate to her and think ""oh, I do those embarrassing stuff too"". instead, she just sings for no reason, which is not funny and just plain annoying. also doing all those ""talking in a funny accent stuff"", like it some show for 5yr old kids.,then Schmidt, who is just a not very attractive douche bag, and not a funny douche in a barney stinson‬‏ way, just weird awkward and very pathetic.,Winston, after watching many episodes, I'm still don't know what his personality is, and what he is doing on this show. It like he's there just to say lines they couldn't put on any other character.,Cece, being a model and always looking like she's in a prom, makes her the most unrelatable character in that show, they also gave her some very basic and boring personality, so it seems she is just there for the pretty face. Then she starts sleeping with Schmidt, who I couldn't found a one thing attractive about.,The only one who was quite fine was nick, but as the show progressed, he became more awkward and weird for no reason like zoey.,I have no idea how this show passed the first season.",New Girl,2
Got Old.,"Really fast.,Always liked Zooey. Just didn't realize it was in small doses. No doubt about it now however because she got really annoying really quickly. ,And if ever a pair of legs were made for jeans not skirts, they're hers.,The guys are bland and trying so hard not to be. Schmidt is suitably cringeworthy but he does have his moments. ,The writing too is repetitive. Awkward sex, conversation, singing and on and on and on... ,Just how much awkwardness can you stand.,Broke girls is unfailingly obnoxious but still manages some real chemistry. New girl has none of that. No really watchable characters to speak of.,Will stick to watching her movies.,Wish them well.,Thank you.",New Girl,
New Girl: Is There Anything New Here?,"TV comedies --- they're so many that you can't possibly watch them all unless you're unemployed and don't sleep regularly. The real question right now is which one has something new and exciting to offer.,How about New Girl? New Girl is about Jess (Zooey Deschanel), a woman who moves in with three guys to deal with her break-up issues.,It is not every day that someone as well-loved as Zooey Deschanel gets her own TV series. She may not be up there with the Oscars people but she has legions of fans that will support whatever material she appears in. Thankfully, these fans will not be disappointed. She takes on her character Jess with such familiarity. Jess is without a doubt one eccentric lady, but one whose innocence and frivolity get to you. I find it odd that she would be dumped by her ex Spencer (Ian Wolterstorff), but let us just assume that he was intoxicated during the time he made the decision and was not thinking very clearly. =) ,The show relies on awkward humor to keep you watching, and for the most part, it works. I am happy to say that it doesn't have a laugh track. I think we have enough of those already and it gets in the way of determining whether a comedy is actually funny or just supposedly funny. Regarding Zooey's support, her crew of guys seem to have interesting personalities, but given that the pilot is only 20 minutes long, it is not enough to determine whether they will be a good complement or just bring disaster. The concept of the show is likable, although not the most original. Somehow, I can't help but think about Ryan Reynolds' Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place in the late 1990s. One thing that I hope New Girl can overcome is becoming repetitive. Aside from Jess going on random dates and the guys helping her, what else can happen? ,To answer the question I posted earlier, no, there isn't something new about this show except we get to be treated to a regular dose of Zooey Deschanel (which is good if you're a fan but sort of worthless if you aren't). However, don't get me wrong. I liked watching the pilot episode of New Girl. I didn't find myself gasping for breath or falling off my seat, but it definitely has its funny moments. Jokes were not as flat as I expected them to be. Many people were skeptic about the show's future but since that it has already been given a full season order, I expect it to at least last another season.,Give it a shot, folks. And keep your fingers crossed. We want more of our Zooey!",New Girl,
One of the best shows by far,"Kept seeing previews of this show while I watched something mindless like Real Housewives or similar. Finally put it on and didn't realize it was a whole season in. Currently binge watching and am almost through the first one....,This show is amazing. I saw it listed as comedy, which it's not in the conventional sense. More of a spot on social commentary. Like a wink and nod to real situations. Most shows have a learning curve where the actors take a few episodes of getting into character. Pilots are normally awful. Not the case with this one. Everyone is so natural where you believe it from the get go. It just keeps getting better with each episode. ,The rating on the tv says MA on every episodes, but I have yet to see anything super offensive compared to half the stuff on tv.",Atlanta,10
One of the best shows on TV,"It's the best half hour comedy/drama to come out in a long time. Great acting, directing and even better writing. Donald Glover is a force to be wreckened with.",Atlanta,10
Not a show for people with brains,"I started out an enthusiastic viewer of New Girl. Zooey Deschanel is pretty darn cute and I was a fan of Max Greenfield since Veronica Mars. That said, as the episodes go by, the characters are becoming two dimensional caricatures of their former selves.,I think this is an eventuality for any show as it progresses, but it's a phenomenon that shows like the Office have managed to stave off for at least 7 or 8 seasons. Seems like it's happening to New Girl in season 2.,When I say it's not a show for people with brains, I mean you can't expect it to stimulate your intellect. Even as entertainment, for me the show is becoming an energysuck and a waste of time. I keep watching to see if it will get better, but I'm disappointed every week. I'm surprised that the showrunner (and purported feminist), Liz Meriwether, has created such vapid female characters. Jess and Cece (the two core female on the show) are in their 30s and have no drive, no direction, no ambition, and no wit. The males fare a little better with Schmidt, but not by much. Above all, none of these characters seem to advance in any way from episode to episode and the storyline is never remarkably original or intriguing. It's like Groundhog Day every week. ,I can't help thinking that if weren't for Zooey and her giant eyes and Hannah Simone in general, no one would watch this show. I wonder how far New Girl will go, riding on the American audience's naivete. Probably quite far.",New Girl,2
Can't get that Paper Boi song out of my head,"After just finishing the first season, that I almost binge watched since the episodes are so short, I can see the potential of this series to go for many more seasons. It's not hilarious but there are some subtle humorous passages that makes you want to watch more. Brian Tyree Henry as Paper Boi is to me the funniest character of this show, and I think the whole series should be more centered about his character. The rest of the cast is also good, and all contribute in a different way to the story. A story about people trying to make it in the rap scene and in their daily lifes. I'm going to start the second season and I expect to still be entertained by this easy to watch show. Perfect to finish an evening before going to sleep.",Atlanta,7
I Really Like This So Far,"I'm only a couple episodes in but this is a pleasant surprise. I've hovered over the show a few times, considered watching it, but you never know with comedies. So far I would call it a bit of a dramedy as the comedy is pretty subtle so far. The acting is really good and I really like the storytelling and pacing. Excellent writing. Thus far I would say the show floats somewhere between and 8 and 9 for me. I really loved the scene with the main character in the jail processing area. You really felt for him. And seeing all the crazy characters around him and their banter. I also liked seeing the perspective of Paperboy and his early stages of finding attention from fans and the stress of being labeled an old school rapper. Just a very well done show.",Atlanta,8
Donald Glover Unleashed and that's a Great Thing,"If you already know who Donald Glover is than you already know this show is going to be funny, nuanced, intelligent and captivating. You also know he isn't Danny Glover's g0dd@mn son. This is a man who is, in real life, a writer, actor, singer, DJ, and creator and has combined all his best attributes, amalgamating them into the series ""Atlanta."" You may know the singer Childish Gambino"", or heard him on the radio and didn't even know it, or just have seen Donald Glover on a number of shows, but to really understand him watch one of his stand-up specials on Netflix and I doubt he is not entertaining/hysterical/thought provoking to many people. He comes across with a realness and genuine quality that is hard to find in comedy and when you see his repertoire of talents it hard to see them, stand back and just wonder how many things will this man produce in my lifetime (I'm 34). This show is off to a great start and I will absolutely watch anything starring this gentleman. Do your thang (sic) Paper Boi (sic?), because you got the right stuff, wet.",Atlanta,10
Not funny at all.,"Frankly I don't find this series to be funny enough to be called a comedy. The jokes fall off short they are not funny and they are sexual at times when they don't need to be sexual. And I don't think the acting is that good. So is the story line. I haven't found any episode that I find funny enough that I actually laughed out loud. The stories are not realistic and not funny and I guess that's pretty much it. There isn't a single thing I like about the series except for the character cece and it's just because I think she's very pretty and she has a nice body. and I am a girl! What I classify as a good comedy- or a comedy that deserves a rating above seven are how I Met your mother, friends, everybody loves Raymond, scrubs, but definitely not new girl. I'll give this series a 2/ 10 for the effort",New Girl,2
Can someone explain to me why this show is funny AND still on the air?,"I like to think of myself as very open and forgiving when it comes to most things in life, including entertainment. I get why some people like ""Rent"" and I do not. I get why ""MST3K"" went on for so long even though my wife and I don't like most of the movies (too boring.) they were making fun of. But what I absolutely DO NOT understand is why on Earth, everyone and their mother ""raves"" about ""New Girl."" Now, I've liked my share of flops, either from fandom (yes....I did like the Dare Devil movie....flame now or forever hold your peace.), or because it was catchy in the beginning.....Kyle XY season 1 was so well written and reasonably acted, I watched until the show's demise, and even petitioned a return, which seldom works...I know.,After the upcoming new show commercials aired to promote newbie shows I thought....this does not seem funny. I thought ""hey...that chick from 'Cloverfield' is kind of cute"".....lol realizing later it wasn't her. But that's about it. Beyond her cute appearance and mannerisms (reminiscent of Dharma and Greg....which at least had some redeeming moments), there is nothing good about this show.,I watched the pilot.....did not laugh once. Episodes 2 and 3....barely got smiles from me....and I'm often told I'm the guy who is always laughing at everything, even the unfunny stuff....which is true, I love comedy. That makes it even more disturbing....that I'm not laughing and all my friends are. The humor isn't high-brow Dennis Miller/Bill Maher type of comedy (which I do enjoy). It isn't Beavis and Butthead stupid (which I also enjoy). It's mildly amusing situations. A girl having a crush on an older man....teehee, how cute. Oh and the mother walks in to find her wrapped in bras....awww....teehee....how cute. And that's about every episode.....""awww, how cute...the character grew a little."" I saw more character growth in the movie ""Tank Girl,"" which actually got a few laughs from me.,The friends are a group of people whom you find living together in a million years. I mean how many guys in their 30's do you know sharing a loft with 3 other guys. They all have decent career paths but somehow can't afford to live alone. The cast is what Seinfeld would have been if they had all lived together....the show wouldn't have worked and been dumped by the network after a few episodes. Meanwhile, I see shows that are good getting canceled.....most notably ""ManUP""...I've noticed almost every title Dan Fogler is in either does moderately well or goes belly up. The sad part about that is, everything he's in is almost always a riot. The dude has such a comedic presence....whether it's his delivery or a quick look. Just looking at him almost provides a chuckle. ""ManUP"" wasn't ground-breaking, or ""new"" in it's style....but it worked. Character's constantly conflicting, growing, and building off one another while being humorous. These are all the adjectives I cannot use to describe ""New Girl."" I'm almost afraid it's so popular and liked because a group of people started liking it and now everyone has to. see American Idol/Survivor/Any ""reality"" t.v. show.,At least ""Arrested Development"" will be back next year....I do have that to look forward to.",New Girl,1
"un realistic, unoriginal and very try hard","1. The jokes are like they are written by Compute Science majors with no sense of originality. These jokes are 10 years behind when they not funny then either. It's very painful.,2. I understand that the writers are trying to capitalize on the 'Zooey is eccentric but good looking' thing and the awkward unrealistic comedy routine that has been done to death and better by 1 million other films we had to sit through. By the way, Zooey sounds like drunk pee wee Herman.,3. Check this out:,Comedy character financial and social status by country:,UK - Low income families in small town houses. Realistic lifestyles.,Australia - Middle class families in average houses by the beach. A little unrealistic adventure lifestyles.,USA - Massive apartments or mansions. Every character is beautiful unless they want to roast some unfortunate less attractive person. Chorus lines in public places (zzzzzzz) hooded clean jumpers lounging in 4 million dollar apartments when they have no job. People that have jobs are advertising executives and high power lawyers about to make partner and all these completely un-realistic demographics to make the audience envy people that have 'better' more affluent lives. Ego.,4. So, basically, a TV series that tries way to hard and I bet gets pulled due to its unoriginality and blatant saturation of the ego centric rich kids living in massive downtown apartment stereotype combined with micromanaged social problems based on the characters plain stupidity and lack of awareness of what is important in life.,I would give it a 0 (zero) but I am not allowed to vote that low. Maybe even a negative double digit number.",New Girl,1
What happened to this show?,"I am writing this in hopes that someone who matters may listen. New Girl used to be hilarious and enjoyable. Over the past season, I have noticed that many changes have happened and each one sucks: New writer or new writers because the content has changed; Damon Wayans Jr is not funny and this seemed to coincide with his appearance; The show has essentially become an advertisement for sponsors - last week it was Target and this week it was Tommy Hilfiger. Oh yes, and they just started doing the corny ending to most episodes where everyone sings together..... Gah!,This show now sucks and I hope I am not alone in this thought.,Hopefully some changes happen and if not, hopefully the axe falls sooner than later.",New Girl,1
New Girl Not That Funny,"i don't think new girl is funny. yes, Schmitt is funny, but Jess is trying so hard to be a dork and it just don't work.. yeah sometimes i smile, but most of the time new girl just awful, its annoying and i don't understand why they say new girl gets the highest rating of the decade. i prefer to watch how i met your mother, or raising hope, or the office (of course) because it gives a big laugh.. New girl are better to be a drama, not a comedy drama because it's full of drama and just a little comedy in it. i don't like new girl and i don't understand why people like it. is it because Zoey already famous for 500 days of summer and all other stuff? OK i like deschanel in 500 days of summer and others, but new girl is annoying and its aired so many times in my TV cable. please stop new girl for being so not funny. and for jess character it just don't work out. sorry for the fans but you must admit it's not funny.",New Girl,1
"this is so bad, i wanted to like it but...","First off, I love Zooey Deschanel, so I was really looking forward to this airing. I've seen her in a few movies and she's always been a great supporting actress. Perhaps she cannot pull off a leading actress role. Even her acting in this series is terrible. I was so disappointed after the first episode. Even more surprising was the rave reviews it was receiving. So I thought, OK maybe I missed something. I tried to watch the second episode but i felt like i was insulting my intelligence and had to change the channel. I think Zooey should stick to the big screen.,The entire storyline is beyond ridiculous, I cannot relate to anything in it.,The only thing funny about this show is that they are still on the air.",New Girl,1
Mediocre at best,"I decided to watch this show after many people telling me it was really good. I have always been kind of on the fence with Zooey Deschenel and this show pushed me over the edge. I just can't watch her anymore, she is totally disingenuous.Her acting is artificial and she is not funny at all. Stop trying so hard! Please! I don't understand why everyone likes this show...it is tripe. I could get my neighbour's parakeet to write a better story. Id rather watch a 6 hour Tom Cruise monologue...strapped to the seat like in Clockwork Orange. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is because I feel like some of the actors on the show are trying, and its not their fault that the writing and lead character blow.",New Girl,3
Maybe Maybe Maybe,"Let me start this review off first by saying that I am a huge fan of Zooey Deschanel. Honestly, I'm a fan of the whole Deschanel clan including Emily Deschanel in ""Bones"" and even the mom, Mary Jo Deschanel in ""Twin Peaks"" from the early 90s.,The first episode started off pretty great. The concept of the show while not original in itself (one girl and several guy friends - ""My Boys,"" ""Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Place"" etc.) still manages to show a unique perspective. This girl with her many guy friends, while a typically weird Zooey Deschanel character (she got a show because we love this about her) is oddly quite feminine as are the guys that surround her. The initial scenario of the break-up while in the midst of a surprise seduction was hilarious and fresh at least for television.,There was a change-up with the cast where the token black roommate (""Coach"") was replaced with another token black roommate (""Winston""). This was done early enough that it didn't phase me all that much when it happened.,The pilot being a great beginning, what I've noticed with the latest episodes is that Zooey Deschanel (""Jess"") doesn't seem to have any character depth. There's no explanation or deeper understanding of why she does what she does or is the way she is. I'm not even sure she has a job. All of her relationships with the current boys, her friend or her ex seem to be superficial and mere affectations of her quirky persona rather than in anyway real or relatable.,The character of ""Nick"" seems to be sucking all of the character depth. He's obsessed with his ex (ok we've all sort of been there though not to his level) and his behavior is understandable, and relatable. This also gives him a back-story and explanation for his actions. I actually am starting to like him more than ""Jess"" at the moment.,I'm putting five out of ten down because I expected more from this show. I'm also putting five out of ten down because I am desperately hoping that when the show comes back in November that it will add more depth to Jess and the other guys. What does she do for a living? Was her mom an agoraphobic shut-in? Was her dad a narcissistic workaholic that wouldn't pay attention unless she sang? How did she meet her model friend? Why did her ex cheat on her? Was it because he couldn't take any more of her quirks? Has this happened to her before? ,This show has amazing potential. I think to be successful to Zooey fans, its got to give us more. Here's hoping!",New Girl,
very stereotype,"That show is pretty bad... the concept is indeed very old but also approved and could work at least as a nice feel-good series (epecially with this lead-actress) if done right. But really this series doesn't feel good, it hurts. The show is all about sexual stereotypes and clichés. A young and hot and totally quirky ""girrl"" moves into a huge yuppie-flat together with 3 good looking shaped body homophobic male role models. She turns their live around by singing and being cute and doing totally crazy girlie stuff which only a very boring person (like her roommates) could find totally crazy. It seems like the 3 guys never got in contact with female characters before. Unless they are total nerds (which they are not - i think they hate nerds) or gay (which they are not - i think they hate gay people) they must be idiots. Besides of being pretty unrealistic all characters are really very stereotype plain stupid. Its the kind of characters you hate for being so dumb and shallow. I could not help but think ""wow, this is kind of sexist"" a couple of times while watching the pilot. Don't get me wrong: I am able to enjoy stupid feel-good sitcom series like ""Two and a half men"" but ""New girl"" is just not funny and likable.",New Girl,1
"New Girl, Old Story","This sitcom has also been played out many times before. It's been done, and overdone, and we are tired of seeing it. First, why would these three men need a roommate? Why would she move in with three strangers? Too contrived to be convincing. Zooey is cute, but she is exactly the same in every single thing she is in. I kept thinking of the movie Elf and that naiveté that was at once cute and annoying. Here it is more annoying than cute.,This one will be cut from the line up soon and with good reason. At any time, on many stations, you can find similar situation comedies playing out before your eyes. Most are done better.,I don't think there can ever really be a workable remake of Friends. I truly wish they would stop trying. It is the ruin of many careers.",New Girl,1
Not new at all,"I really like Zooey Deschanel and all but this is just an awful show. Acting is irritating to say at best. Characters are also irritating and boring as hell. Zooey's character especially. The whole concept of the show is nothing new and refreshing. ""New Girl"" is not funny or entertaining at all. Far from it. It's tragic how bad this show really is.,I wouldn't recommend ""New Girl"" to anyone. Not even a Zooey's fan. Hell, not even an enemy. It's that bad. And honestly I'm surprised how high score this show has here on IMDb. What the hell is wrong with you people?!

The alien colonies and factions are chackras/aliens (yes this movie is a mess),"Spoilers: Multi reality travelling aliens take human body forms. Each reality/ colony that the aliens go to correspond to one of their factions and one of the chackras (yes, the movie is convoluted. I'm explaining it really well). Aliens are divided into parents and children. Once the aliens travel through all of the chackras/ realities (earth being the last), they get eaten by the parents. Only parents get to vote. The aliens have very strict rules about what they can and can't do on Earth. The aliens are having each time less and less offspring. The oldest one intended to let the fathers eat their offspring and then eat the fathers, and then eat itself into oblivion. One of the offspring (Dakota Fanning) is against the conformity, and has sex with a punk teenager. She gets pregnant and in order to be able to have a vote and to vote for the whole alien species to stop eating the young aliens, she needs to have the babies in the outter dimension (she will never be able to come back). She jumps from a building discarding her body. Many years in the future, the punk teen is a famous Graphic Novel writer who wrote about the aliens he met. A group of his children come to talk to him pretending they are his fans at first. Whe he realises he's talking to his kids, he gets emotional and the movie ends.",How to Talk to Girls at Parties,1

Basically I have no idea what was going on. It watches like a pretentious 6th form drama school project. I'm guessing it was made on a budget & I was surprised at some of the names involved. ,The only good performance is that of Elle Fanning - she's stunning to look at & has that natural ability to make people empathise.

FOR OLD CHILDREN,"Kids today will never guess what this picture is about, a word called Anarchy. ,And yes.. we where young also, and yes... we waned to have bands... and yes we where artist... and yes we also took drugs and wanted to make a HUGE statement about life and the universe... and this is what indirectly this movie is about. I blame the Director a bit for not making this important statement it a little bit more mature, because this movies is encapsulated in the Family/Disney Aesthetics and mind way of doing things, and looks and PUNK was not suppose to be like this AT ALL.,For me the movie was about a young family teen in the Punk 77 era, simple as that, trying to do a band, or was it a big art statement... To those that lived in such a ""revolution"" should recognize with ease a stereotyped crazy young wannabe artist trying to make Anarchist art??? a movie about that crazy character brain??? is that even possible? how can you make art out of idea that are not even coherent one with the other, i was one of them so i figured this movie to be something great. This is what this movie is about you stwpid facks that gave it one star. ,Also i know this movie was based on Neil Gaiman short story which only makes me think there was a better source material somewhere that i have to read now, and gave me more respect for the creator of Coraline.,So long story short, we are seeing what this young fellow sees, how he explains it to its friends, how he interprets the universe. Probably if this movie was done from the exterior we would have a movie about a drug cocaine addict that had some ideas and end up working with a suit until dead.... This movie fails to show us the line between reality and magic.,You can still find this kind of ""rambling"" characters everywhere today also, this is a movie that only they will understand, keep dreaming about your art and be truth to it.,I do remember about Anarchy and this generation will give us some PUNK soon enough, so prepare your establishments this movie yet not really ""cult"" should remind us that being young is not only about ""learning how to speak to girls at parties""...Anarchy to love and everything that is good or bad. cant wait 20 years from now to see the artistic product of this meme generation, it will be awesome!.,i give this movie a 4/10 because it failed to transmit this train of thought, and because the plasticity of the Aesthetics is really out of place and diminishing to the overall idea.",How to Talk to Girls at Parties,4

It is a beautiful story, I wanted more of it, and this movie delivered for me.,If you want to know what you are getting into before watching, it is a blend of romanticized teenage punk scene with fantasy world aliens. It is nostalgic, fun, and touching. You can read the short story before watching the movie, or read the comic book (it is beautiful).,Some negative reviews I've seen say the movie failed their expectations, which were based solely on the title (lol), or cast.

How to Talk to Girls at Parties (2018),"SPOILER: This film came out today in a very limited release but its something I was always going to see because I love Elle Fanning. I kind of forgot that this was a sci-fi inspired comedy. The film has a typically committed performance from Elle Fanning and a very interesting concept and clash between a quirky cult and British punks. Its certainly creative but does not always hit its highs despite having a lot going for it.,The film follows three young kids who are used very into the London pop scene of the 60's. One night they stumble across a house party. Once they go in they see very odd individuals who are very odd, dressed in bright colors, and fairly sexual. It turns out this group are actually aliens exploring Earth and its people The main lead Enn, meets a young girl and hits it off with her as she tries to understand his world and falls in love with him.,Thought the premise for this film was strong and added color and humor to the film. However, the film does feel stretched thin at some points. Its not a shock as Neil Gaiman's short story of the same name is about twenty pages long. Liberties had to be taken and I found a good portion to be enjoyable. The alien plotline and their motives do get muddled though as its not very clear and seems to have too much complexity for the film to handle.,I think the best part of the film was Elle Fanning as the alien. She really is able to transform into that role of a young alien who is trying to learn how the world works and how love works. She also undergoes a shift when she discovers ""punk"". I'm happy I watched it as its quite unique. The film hits a wall at times but recovers well enough. Also, Nicole Kidman is ace in it.,6.5/10",How to Talk to Girls at Parties,6
It's British.,"I imagine this film may be hard to digest for some, as a lot of British films can be. I typically do not enjoy British films or T.V. series. I don't find their comedy all that funny, and their Sci-Fi tends to be overly dramatic and sappy. This film is very ""artsy"", and theatrical. It reminded me of Dr. Who, The Fifth Element, Under the Skin, and The Worlds End.

20-somethings and the Goonies,"Just prior to graduating with a degree in Film Studies a lecturer asked us, ""So what's your favourite film now?"" Whilst my peers spouted out Goddard films and obscure German expressionist shorts I sat quietly thinking; my favourite film has been My Favourite Film since I was seven... So when it came to me and I mumbled ""The Goonies"", I was expecting scorn, ridicule and possibly minor injury, but instead was met with concurring shouts and whoops and cries of ""Hey you gu-uys!"" from the rest of the class. You see this is the unifying thing about The Goonies; mention it in a room full of twenty-somethings and they'll whell up and utter ""Sloth loves Chunk"" or adopt a harassed Chinese tone ""Thats what I said...Booty traps!"". And if that room happens to be a pub, several chairs will scrape back and semi-inebriated grown men will lift their shirts, shake their bellies and revel in the truffle shuffle. People may say it's an Indiana Jones wanna-be I think that is the defining beauty of it all. When we first watched The Goonies it was like watching our dreams come true on screen! We'd loved seeing Indiana's adventures and escapades and in The Goonies we saw kids like us actually doing it! They got to be just like the mini-Indies we imagined ourselves to be in the playground. But its not just the adventure that makes us love the film, we love those Goonies themselves. They were like our friends. We got annoyed with them sometimes, and we wanted to protect them, and we laughed at their jokes and cheered when they had a brilliant plan. Identifying with those kids was what we loved and why, as adults, we quote them and 'become' them when talking about the film. I still want to be like Andy, having a perilous adventure sliding down tunnels and facing the bad guys on a huge pirate ship... but of course also making time to kiss Brand AND Mikey! I also think that this is why Goonies 2 is such a relevant and exciting concept. We've all grown up together and I'd love to see how the guys are doing now...I just hope it doesn't disappoint... So if you've not seen it do it right now, and if you have kids sit them down, hold their hand through the scary bits and enjoy! They'll thank you in twenty years time!",The Goonies,10
Goonies r good enough,"Anyone who grew up in the 80's will list the Goonies as one of their favourite films, or at least look back at it with a misty eye.,It had everthing you could want, thrills, spills, pirates, booty, adventure, freaks and bad guys. I just wanted to be a Goonie or go on a Goonie style adventure. Even the place where they lived was cool. A big old house in a picturesque bay town. You don't get houses like that in England. The only interesting thing you would have found in my loft would have been a dead pidgeon.,Then there were the Goonies themselves who just seemed so cool. Data's gadgets and smart mouthed ..erm.. Mouth.,We are first introduced to them one by one in the fantastic introductory sequence. The bad guys of the piece, the Fratellis, organise a jailbreak in a huge 4x4. In the process of doing so they speed past every member of the Goonies, introducing their character traits. Then they all get together at the leader Mikies house and just doss around for a while feeling sorry for themselves, because a property magnate wants to but there little town and turn it into a country club (although the bay looks like it would make a poor golf course, but hey). So this is the Goonies last day together and they have to do something about it. And don't they just.,What follows is like a comedy Hardy Boys crossed with a game of Mousetrap. Some of the set pieces are genius (the pirate, One eyed Willie, had a penchant for elaborate traps to stop people pinching his booty) and the sets are equally inventive. The gang get themselves into various scrapes with the traps, or the Fratellis or both and somehow always come out on top.,Richard Donner's direction is always brisk, the young actors performances are superb (specially the fantastic 'Chunk'), the senior cast is very good and the dialogue is chock full of hilarious lines.,I must admit I look back at it through rose tinted glasses. I was in awe of it when I was a kid, and now when I watch it, it reminds me of my childhood and all the things that was great about it. I cant fault the Goonies, even now. I still believe it is the perfect kids film.,I am probably preaching to the converted, but if you havent seen the Goonies, go and buy it now! And if you don't like it, what the hell is wrong with you!?!?!?",The Goonies,10
The Goonies ARE good enough,"It was in 2001 or thereabouts that I watched and listened to the audio commentary track that is on the DVD version of The Goonies. Nostalgia is a wonderful thing, and seeing how the principal cast had aged (or hardly aged in Josh Brolin's case) was worth the price of admission on its own. But this is just one of The Goonies' selling points. Despite what the IMDb's ratings would have you believe, it is an immortal classic that warrants repeated and frequent viewings. It is not a coincidence that many of its cast and crew have repeatedly appeared in all sorts of productions before and since. Indeed, this was probably the first film that introduced me to the reality that the same actor will often play ten different parts in ten different films when I realised that Jonathan Ke Quan was the same brat that made parts of Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom so amusing. Seeing him in the video-enhanced commentary of the DVD nearly two decades later was a surprise and a half.,The film revolves around a group of children and adolescents who live in the poorer, less trendy part of a beachfront town. Unlike an episode of Barney, every member of this principal group is given a background and a string of differences from their castmates. You will not see the teenaged Brand responding to the same situation in the same manner as the ten year old Mikey, and that is where a major part of the film's strength is derived. The only weakness in the characterisations is with Martha Plimpton and Kerri Green, who join the adventuring boys a little way into the film. Exactly what they are doing other than giving the character of Brand something similar to himself to bounce his more adult-oriented lines from is anyone's guess, but they do work in their limited capacity. It is just a pity that Chris Columbus' screenplay did not give them a little more to do, other than defuse one fiendish trap towards the end of the ride.,Speaking of fiendish traps, the adventurers journey from one puzzling location to the next with barely a stop for breath. It works because unlike similar adventure films where the director expects us to be impressed by a fiendish-sounding name, the specific places that are visited by the Goonies have function. The bone piano shown in one such sequence, for example, would appear in the nightmares of children learning a regular piano for years after the film's theatrical release. It also gives Corey Feldman a good chance to act out a character who speaks very fluent Spanish. And while I am on that subject, who could forget the immortal scene early on in the film where Mouth deliberately loses something in the translation when Rosalita is shown around? But the prize for scene-stealing goes to John Matuszak, who plays the unofficial eighth Goonie, Sloth, with a weird aplomb that may well scare the willies out of parts of the intended audience. But then, in 1985, scaring the intended audience a little was considered a healthy part of making a film for those in the age ranges depicted here.,They say you cannot have a good protagonist without a good antagonist to bounce off. Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano, and Anne Ramsey provide antagonists so good that they utterly hose the rule about not working with animals or children. The Fratellis work so well here because they are working with children. The late Anne Ramsey played her part so well that the mere thought of watching her in anything scared the willies out of me for years. Nowadays, as I have fully realised the mechanics behind film for some years, I am keen as mustard to see some of her other work in such pieces as Throw Momma From The Train (now there's a title that brings images to mind) or Meet the Hollowheads. That a performance can produce two entirely different reactions in the same person at different stages of their life should tell you all you need to know about its quality. Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano are somewhat overshadowed here, but the manic, cackling quality of their introductory act also left quite a lasting impression.,You might have noticed that I have so far only mentioned the special effects in passing while heaping praise upon the acting. This is because unlike films such as the recent Star Wars prequels, the effects complement the acting rather than overshadow it. From what I am able to tell, all of the effects in The Goonies are practical, and some of them quite inventive. There is no use of blood squibs, which may disappoint some viewers, but there are enough mechanical sets and air vents to fill three films. Some of these effects did not turn out so well and were cut from the final film (the squid sequence being the most famous example), but unlike a lot of films that depend on special effects for a crucial element, everything shown in the final cut is in perfect sync here. Suspension of disbelief is never an issue, which is just as well considering some of the preposterous things that roll by the screen with a certain nonchalance.,I gave The Goonies a ten out of ten. Like Superman or the original Lethal Weapon, it shows that Richard Donner knows how to make a classic. Now that it is twenty years old, it stands forever as a relic of a time when the world of those under the age of eighteen was far less oppressive. If you have not introduced your children around the age of ten or greater to its joys and moments, then shame on you.",The Goonies,10
"Fun fun fun, but first you have to do the truffle shuffle!","Treasure hunts.  Who doesn't remember digging under the porch, in creekbeds, hollowed out logs, etc to find the buried treasure you just KNOW is hidden there somewhere?  The Goonies is a fun-filled ride right back into our youth where treasure hunts are no longer a thing of the past.,I absolutely loved this movie.  It was just so much fun to watch when I was a kid and just as much fun when I watched it again as an adult with my own kids.  Of course the movie has moments of predictability, and no, the villains aren't all that intimidating...they're actually quite moronic. But that only adds to the charm of this movie as well as its comedic value. Although there are lessons peppered in (don't judge by appearances, right vs. wrong, etc), overall, The Goonies is a wonderful exploration of childhood friendships and imaginations...from Data and his many scientific creations to One Eyed Willy and his pirate ship.,There isn't a character in this movie I didn't fully enjoy watching...you have the dim-witted, evil Fratelli's, heavy-set, melodramatic Chunk, Data with his ""booty traps...that's what I said, booby traps"" galore, the odd-looking but loveable Sloth, and Mouth with his, well, Mouth.  Those are only a few...there are many more.  A lot of great lines come from this movie along with memorable moments (the Truffle Shuffle).  I've seen The Goonies about a hundred times and I STILL enjoy watching it over and over again.,
This is absolutely a pure, fun-filled movie to enjoy with your kids, grandkids, nieces and nephews, or simply by yourself.  Hang on and enjoy the ride!  The Goonies earns a solid 5 out of 5 stars!",The Goonies,10
Steven Spielberg exercises the farthest reached of his imagination in this unforgettable tale of childhood adventures.,"Every kid has imagined what it would be like to go on great and glorious adventures. Pirate ships, police chases, treasure chests full of gold and surrounded by human skeletons with patches over the eyes, the inherent excitement in the possibility of a cavernous wonder world beneath the very streets where they live. The Goonies is about a group of kids who have grown up together and are about to be torn apart because their parents are being forced to sell their homes. In the attic of one of their houses (Mikey, played by Sean Astin), they find an endless supply of fascinating things - treasure maps, paintings, cryptic writings in strange languages. They find a map that sounds promising, and decide to see if it has any value, hoping to be able to find enough treasure to prevent their parents from losing their homes. ,Not only was The Goonies a brilliantly written, directed, and acted movie, but it was also so much FUN! The adventures of these kids through the underground world, while being chased by the despicable villains known as the Fratellis, are fascinating to watch. The Goonies is a great cinematic experience. It has everything that anyone who was ever a kid could ever want. Even the elaborate sets are very convincing. ,The sense of adventure and hope that are presented in The Goonies is very uplifting and inspiring. The lovable characters are perfectly developed and endlessly entertaining. Many of them, particularly Sean Astin and Corey Feldman, delivered the best performances of their future careers right here in this early adventure film. This movie can be enjoyed by virtually anyone, which is one of its best values. It is truly timeless, and it should not be missed.",The Goonies,10
80s adventure flick revives childhood memories!,"The first time I saw THE GOONIES was at a friend's house right when it was a ""new release"" on video. After the best times I had in my life watching it, the friend established a ""Goonie"" club for the fun of it. Perhaps your past childhood memories would have been the same, too! While the movie is a tad heavy on the stupid foul jokes, it does have the imagination of willing to trek around for some perilous adventures, plus a few spooks. There possibly was never a movie like this providing tons of fun and laughter during the time. The characters and their personalities were most original, including ""Data"" and his supply of gadgets, and ""Chunk"" with his obese but likeable image (love that ""Truffle Shuffle""!). But ""Sloth"" easily stole the show with his own likeable personality, a goon with the weirdest face I've ever seen in my life! Just think of how fun it is to discover lost treasure, when you know it's only fantasy. Four key things come to mind with THE GOONIES: pirate ships, teenagers, the Frattellis, and Cyndi Lauper. They're actually ""good enough"" and they go together in this memorable journey! Kudos to Richard Donner for bringing me a movie that I've seen over 100 times and never stop enjoying! After all these years, I'm STILL waiting for a sequel!,HIT PUREE!!!",The Goonies,7
Classic 80s flick,"I love The Goonies.  It is a classic 80s children-adventure film.  They don't make movies like this anymore... of if they do, its children hurting other children (Cruel Intentions... etc).  I do miss that from the 80's... during that time you can have an adventure film that relies on humor and ""monsters"" without an overt display of violence and sex like in todays ""PG13"" movies.  Anyway.. I rant...,
I love all the characters from The Goonies.  Chunk is my fav (truffle shuffle, hostage crisis, Dead things Mikey! Dead Things!, and when he starts spatting off Hebrew when he is captured by the Frattellis).  Its amazing to see the changes in Josh Brolin (Brandon) from back then to his performances today.,I have this movie although it must be a edited version because I heard there was an octopus scene in the uncut version.. Haven't seen it yet.,I heard they were going to make a sequel.. My question.. Why!?! Don't ruin a good thing. Leave it alone and walk away.  Resist all urges for a money-grubbing ""typical hollywood second release"" scenario.,I love the music from The Goonies as I am a huge 80's music fan.,
Lastly, the scene is beautiful.  I live in Portland, Oregon and have traveled to Astoria several times.. It is a pitty to know that the last time I was in Astoria, the house featured in the movie was run-down and looked to be vacant.,10/10.",The Goonies,
Back to our childhood...,"
There was a time when boys would spend a whole day watching their favorite
heroes, dreaming of riding a crusade against Darth Vader's Empire or
fighting the enemies among the Knights of the Round Table. Just like in
the
Fantasy Island, where Mr. Roarke and Tatoo would make all one's wishes
come
true, The Goonies has the special talent to bring our childhood fantasies
back and remind us how great those years were.,In this 1985 movie, a bunch of kids find a map which indicates the spot
where the evil pirate One-Eyed-Willie buried a big treasure stolen from
English ships in the 1500's. As we can predict, they decide to seek for
the
gold and precious stones to help their parents who are about to be
expelled
from their homes because they can't make ends meet and also because some
wealthy men want to put their houses down to build a country club on it's
place. Dangers, traps and even a family of thieves - the Fratelli - are
after them.,As the film goes on, we can see how closer the friends get and how
supportive we all should be. They would always be there for each other, no
matter how deep their problems are. Even a rich girl, Andy, is accepted by
the group, in a very politically correct act, where no distinctions are
made. The scene in which the guys are stuck in a hole, is very touching
and
really digs our sense of aid.,Richard Donner directed this movie and another famous director, Chris
Columbus wrote the screenplay, based on a Steven Spielberg's story. Matt
Sweeney was responsable for the special effects and the main theme ( They
'r
good enough ) was written and performed by Cindy Lauper.,After the film, none of the kids became famous actors. Corey Feldman and
Kerry Green took part in some teenage comedies, while Sean Astin showed up
in ""Memphis Belle"" and Ke Huy Quan was the young Indiana Jone's chinese
taxi
driver in ""The Temple of the Doom"". The only one who joined some serious
projects was Martha Plimpton.,But these are just technical details. What really counts in ""The Goonies""
are the two hours of humanity, pleasure, inocence, friendship - and even
the
first love - that only children can show in their eyes. In fact, it's a
small journey to our past, to a time when your deepest worries were about
the girl (or the boy) on the next chair.

"It's definitely not ""good enough""","I remember as a kid wanting The Goonies to be great, but when I saw it something felt wrong about it. I thought it was okay, but knew it was lacking. I recently saw it again (20 years later), and I know what the problems are. Bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. Everyone yells practically nonstop in the film. You don't believe for a second that any one of these kids is a real person. There's one hint of a decent performance when Sean Astin is recounting the story of One Eyed Willy to his friends in an out of breath monologue. I won't blame the kids, but Spielberg and Donner. Chris Columbus' script felt slapped together in a weekend (probably was under the orders of Spielberg). I have friends who love it, and have fond memories of it as kids, but I guess I've always been overly critical. It's just that I wanted more as a kid. I wanted the same feeling I had when watching Raiders for the first time, or Back To The Future. Those films had something that The Goonies lacked. I'm in the minority, but I just wanted to get it off my chest.",The Goonies,4
"""MY CHILDHOOD DREAM (To be one of them,The GOONIES)""","Well,well,well.......this film has became one of my all-time favorite movie!The first time i watched the movie i just couldn't help myself wishing I was there with them.The movie is so full of adventure!But what really bothered me was the exact date it was filmed!Oh my gosh it was dated back in 1985!I was not even born by that time.....But hey they did a pretty good job!I wish i could owned this in DVD so i can watched anytime & show this to my children.But it was so hard to find. So i guess i just had to stick to our cable.,It was amazing to see Sean Astin(Mikey)so young and active.You could certainly see the difference he is now in Lord of the Rings trilogy. The story isn't like any...it was so unique!The place and view are awesome and was actually filmed in the City of Astoria.,My favorite character is Mikey and Josh.They are two brothers who wants to help their parents.So Mikey,being the youngest wants to find that treasure to save them from Troy's dad.My favorite lines were.... ""When you look in the sky,it will be another town,when you see your friends,it will be in another school"".,It's kinda touchy and sentiment....but good!I remember the new album of Ataris(So long Astoria)where it became one of their song.I was reading the lyrics and there was a similarity in the movie.The last part goes like this,,""So long Astoria,i found a map to buried treasure and even if we come home empty-handed we still have our stories of pirate ships & wounded hearts,broken bones and the best of friendships.& when this hourglass out its final grain of sand.I raised my glass to the memories we had.This is my wish,i'm taking them back,I'm taking them all back."",I remember mouth said the last lines when they were trapped inside the cave.I guess the band members of Ataris saw the movie in their childhood years and like them,we were spell-binded by its great story.,So long The Goonies,you will be remembered as one of the most amazing movies we had.Just like the movie,""The relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks only they're gone faster than the smell of the rain."",But for now,you became a resurrected memories from ashes in our childhood dreams.......",The Goonies,
It must be a nostalgia thing,"I have friends who grew up in the 80s who swear that The Goonies is one of the greatest adventure films ever made. Being in my late teens at the time, I was a little too old to be interested when it first came out, and having finally caught up with the film nearly thirty years later, I can definitely say that I'm waaaay too old for it now. Although I'm usually a sucker for films involving the search for long lost treasure, this noisy, chaotic, poorly acted, desperately unfunny, unexciting waste of a big budget had me wishing I'd never bothered to see what the fuss was all about.,When the most comprehensible lines of dialogue in the whole film come from a mentally disabled, drooling freak called Sloth and a character played by Anne Ramsey, then I know I'm in for a rough time. Quite why Spielberg and Donner opted for such an obnoxious collection of unruly brats for this film I'll never understand, the kids' incessant unintelligible screaming seriously grating on the nerves. Until now, I've always had time for Corey Feldman and Sean Astin, but here they are mostly unbearable; even worse are Ke Huy Quan as amateur inventor Data and loud-mouthed tub of lard Chunk, played by Jeff Cohen, both of whom deliver utterly charmless performances.,If, like me, you've successfully avoided seeing this film for several decades, I suggest that you keep on doing so and save yourself the disappointment.",The Goonies,3
"If you are an adult and haven't seen it already, then don't.","I was 18 when this was released. Just a little bit too old for it. Over the decades I've heard people just a few years my junior rave about this as if it were an Indiana Jones or a gremlins or the like. So finally at the ripe old age of 46 I've had a look. I cannot believe the hype for this. The director's overriding instruction to the actors, seems to have been, shout and scream and say your dialogue whilst everyone else is saying theirs. That will keep the audience thrilled and excited. It gave this member of the audience a headache. The storyline is weak, the characters 2 dimensional and the script is dire. I kept thinking these kids must be off their Ritalin. It was like an onslaught of annoyance. I get that people are nostalgic for movies they saw when they were kids. I still think jaws is one of the greatest films ever made, whereas people younger than me can't abide the plastic shark. But really, I'm amazed that so many people still seem to rate this. I challenge anyone over 40 (in 2013), who hasn't already seen this movie as a kid, to like it!",The Goonies,1
Probably the coolest adventure movie of all time!,"The Goonies is eternally a terrific movie that anyone could easily fall in love with. I was a little surprised honestly that this movie isn't on the top 250, because it seems like everyone agrees with me that this is just a plain excellent movie. After all, it is directed by Steven Spielberg, when has he ever misled us? I think this movie is sort of like a time capsule, because you can tell that it was made in the 80's, but it'll forever remain a treasure that will pass on from generation to the next.,It's about these pre-teen boys who are about to loose their houses to the local rich guys who will turn their houses into a golf course if their parents don't come up with the money that's wanted. When Mikey, the leader of the Goonies, gets his hands on his father's treasure map that belongs to his museum, he shows his friends, including his older brother, Brandon, that maybe this could be their last adventure to find the treasure and pay off the rich guys! Brandon, his girlfriend, Andy, her friend, Steph, Mouth, Data, Chunk, and Mikey come together to find the treasure. But it's gonna be hard when on the run Fratelli's want the treasure as well and will try to get there first! ,The Goonies are just so lovable and I would always recommend this not only for the family, but for yourself as well. Because it has great lines, exciting scenes, and just a fantastic story. Not to mention all the future stars who are in this film like Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, and Robert Davi. There are a few slight goofs that you notice off the bat, but you get past them because it's just such a charming movie.,10/10",The Goonies,10
Certainly NOT the greatest movie ever made...,"Call me a cynic. Not only do I not like this film, but I am amazed at how many people here seem to love it so deeply. I did not see this movie as a child, so I don't have the same exaggerated emotional attachment to it as some. Still, I found it silly, overdone and incredibly annoying. Every one of the forced-cutesy kids in the movie (thanks, Mr. Spielberg!) needs a good throttling. The fat kid is the constant butt of cliched, mean-spirited joking. I have no idea what the Asian kid is saying anywhere in the film. Corey Feldman is obnoxious and, oh.. just happens to be able to translate Spanish and treasure maps and anything else when need be. Uh huh.,The plot is absurd: are we really supposed to believe the kids could so easily track down a 400-year-old treasure that everyone else has overlooked? Would a group of professional counterfeiters run off and leave evidence of their crime in plain sight, knowing that a group of kids is nosing around? I don't think so.,This lame movie is par for the course for Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Bicentennial Man) and one of Spielberg's weaker efforts (right up there with Hook, which suffers from many of the same problems as this film). There are some great films for kids out there. This isn't one of them.",The Goonies,
Idiotic,"Where's my aspirin? After watching this I have a headache. ,I must be one of the only people in the world who dislike this movie. Granted, I did not see it as a kid. As an adult, I found it obnoxious beyond belief mostly because of all the constant chatter and screaming. ""Ahhhhhh"" throughout the movie made me spend a lot of time fast forwarding. The stereotyping was beyond annoying; this is the kind of movie that gives kids permission to think its OK to be annoying and behave like dodos. Yes, I know it was a spoof, but it was still too moronic and sophomoric for my tastes.,The script jumped around and didn't make sense in many places. And tell me why anyone would believe they were building a golf course in the hills of Astoria Oregon. The main house sits on a hill unsuitable for a golf course. We must have had a lot more tolerance for bad scripts in the 80's. I've seen a variety of 80's movies which had awful scripts and were nominated for Oscars.,The Spiderwick Chronicals are 100% better. In fact, I can't think of a worse kid's movie than this one.",The Goonies,1
Atrocious,"The acting, screenplay, and direction are all atrocious in this unwatchable and boring film. Spielberg's cliché-ridden story seems to be made up of leftover ideas from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" The script is amateurish and has no rhyme or reason. It's as if they made up the story as they went along. The kids are simply obnoxious; they talk non-stop and don't say anything interesting. This film is supposedly targeted at youngsters, but it has crude sexual ""humor"" (not the least bit funny) and tasteless violence directed at children. Rather than direct it himself, Spielberg brought in Donner, presumably to spread the blame, but the latter does nothing to save this sinking ship.",The Goonies,1
Incredibly disappointing movie,"Well I have been prepared to see kids movie. Most of the viewers seem to be happy with this move but I just keep to wonder why. It is very chaotic, hardly funny and quite abusive I have to say. But the worst part is it is actually very boring movie. From start to the end there is just sequence of screaming, did the viewers who mentioned their childhood memories keep their youth with never ending shouting like ""UAAAAAAA!!!"" ""IIIIIIIIII!!!"" ""NOOOOOOOO!!!!"" ""UAHAAAAAAA!"" ""WE GOT IT!!!"" ""NOOOOOOO!"" ""HEEEEEELP!!!"" ""WHAAAAATS THAAAAAT?!"" et cerera et cerera. Everyone in the movie is just plain silly - children, parents, police, everyone. The only exception are banditos who are simply brain dead. Its stupid, its just stupid. It's disgusting, literally two hours walk in sewage filled with sewage humor. I'm very happy I've seen this movie on TV and pay nothing for this most unpleasant experience. I'm really happy I have not bought it because I would be very angry because of money wasted.",The Goonies,1
"Too much screaming, horrible acting","After 25+ years, I finally watched this movie with my daughter and after 45 minutes I had to leave the room. The CONSTANT screaming and yelling by all the characters was more than I could take. The dialog was stupid, the characters over-acted, the fat kid was annoying as hell, and the amount of plot holes made this laughable at best. The premise of the movie is great...a remake could do well, but as this stands I couldn't stand to hear one more second of it.,And seriously, they cast Martha Plimpton??? Of all the struggling actors in Hollywood, this is who they picked? I guess they needed a homely girl that couldn't act, so they picked her (with Kerri Green being a close second).",The Goonies,2
Horrible,"I sat with amusement reading these ridiculous ""reviews"" on The Goonies. Ninety-nine percent of them written by people who saw it when they were five or eight and who are 80s children. Well, what a stinker it is. I've avoided it like the plague all these years, but now I've seen it and I'm here to tell you I almost threw my shoe through the TV. The ""characters"" are so unrelentingly stupid and irritating, the ""script"" is one bad sequence after another and loaded with some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a mainstream film. It is a career low for everyone, if you ask me. You know, I saw lots of movies when I was a kid (not in the 80s) and while I can think back with fondness on some of them, I'm also not living in my past - and I can recognize that while it may have been swell when I was five, while it may hold some nostalgia value, I can also recognize a stinker when I see one from my past.,But that's the deal with 80s children - they don't grow up. Same with 90s and the 2000s. Nobody grows up - thirty is the new ten and the world is not a pretty place. The one redeeming feature of The Goonies is its Dave Grusin score, which is terrific. Simply put, one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen some doozies.",The Goonies,1
The Goonies: This is the ultimate crap.,"So how can I explain why this remains as the ultimate crap? I thought ""The Goonies"" was supposed to be a great exciting kids-adventure, but this is a horrible thing from start to end. Everything in this film could be so much better. It is never exciting and never funny, even if it somehow tries to be funny with stupid jokes. The characters are empty all over and really uninspiring. You just want to stop watching. The end is stupid and without any kind of joy, the villains are not really menacing or frightening as I thought they would be, they are just dull. The film doesn't have the guts to take it self seriously any time. And I really hate irritating fat children in movies that just can eat and scream! If you want to experience proper 1980's adventure films you could see 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'Stand by Me' instead.,Richard Donner proved that he can direct entertainment with ""The Omen"" but ""The Goonies"" was a big mistake, with horrible bad uninspired direction - all the acting was worse than it could be and the film didn't have any atmosphere or mood at all. Spielberg and Columbus' script was also awful and should have been less dull. Maybe ""The Goonies"" had some potential to be a good adventure-movie but it failed at all points.,Rating: 1 of 10.",The Goonies,1
To ^stupidity and beyond,"This film seems to be considered a minor classic for children. The rating is quite high, many people have seen the movie, there's been a video game inspired by it, ... and there's Spielberg who produced and wrote the film. Then it MUST be good?  Think again! The truth is that this is an inconceivable mess. Whoever thought this was funny, should be locked up and put away forever. There's not even a chuckle during the whole length of the film. And I can assure you that this film seems to be going on forever! So is it entertaining then? Surely not. This film is as boring and stupid as it gets. Imagine a bunch of irritating children( all with some sort of speaking disorder, it seems), yelling their way through the ""story"". Think of PROBLEM CHILD, LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO, even the POLICE ACADEMY FILMS... get the picture? Not yet? Then picture three idiotic villains (does Joe Pantaliano even recall his ""performance"" here?), a search for a hidden treasure (it takes a while to figure that out)and some sort of friendly ""monster"" (that reminded me of THE TOXIC AVENGER!), all of which seems awfully out of place in this film. Of course, this is a children's movie, I can understand that. And, like so many others of its kind, it's stupid, very stupid. And I guess you have to be a kid yourself to enjoy such films. But ""stupid"" doesn't actually mean ""bad"". There are many enjoyable, clever and sweet ""family films"". But this loud-mouthed, dumb mess isn't one of them. Oh, and there's actually a scene in which there's being referred to GREMLINS, another Spielberg production from a year before this one. Check out that one instead, at least there's a whole lot more cleverness in it than here. And don't say that it's too scary for children, THE GOONIES is ten times more scarier. And boring. Did I mention that already? 3/10",The Goonies,3
The greatest film of the 80s,"The Goonies is a must-see for anyone who love movies, it is a treasure. The film is about a batch of kids named The Goonies who find a treasure map in a attic. When one of them realise that this may actually lead them to treasure he and his buddies decide to go on a fascinating hunt for it in a effort to save them from being forced out of their homes. Along the way they meet three crooks and Sloth- a lovable character who makes friends with the ""truffle shuffle kid"" Chunk, after he is caught by the crooks, and together they go looking for his friends to rescue them. So i advise you, anyone who has not seen this movie watch it as you will certainly be missing out otherwise. You will like this movie if you like films such as ""The Never-Ending Story"", ""Legend"", ""Gremlins"" and ""Labyrinth""",The Goonies,10
Silly but good fun for pre-teens and young teenagers,"Mikey Walsh and his friends face separation as they all prepare to move away as developers buy up their properties.  The only hope is that they can raise enough money to keep the house.  When they stumble across a map relating to the long lost treasure of pirate `One-Eyed' Willy they go after the treasure but it leads them to tunnels under the hideout of the Fratelli family who are on the run from the law - the Goonies must get the treasure before the Fratelli's can find it.,I haven't seen this film for many years and, when someone told me it was their favourite film I couldn't really voice an opinion (or at least, not an informed one).  Having now seen it myself I must admit to be a little at a loss to understand the sheer amount of cult love it gets; I can only put it down to us all loving something from our childhood in a guilty sort of way! The film is enjoyable but no more than that, and I wasn't sure who it was aimed at: it seemed to be too scary for young children but far too childish and silly for older kids.  The plot is a sort of Indiana Jones for children and it works reasonably well despite an excess of flaws in several key areas.,The plot is silly and feels very disjointed, I was never totally sold on the treasure hunt nor the threat of the Fratelli's. It varies wildly between sickly sentiment (`I'm gonna take care of you', `you're my best invention' etc) and overblown action that doesn't really excite because it is so unrelated to reality.  The effects can be forgiven due to the age of the film, but really it should have been more dramatic considering.  The comedy also swings wildly from silly slapstick to some very funny lines; the whole thing is very rough around the edges and it is quite refreshing to see this in comparison to so many more `clean' and shrink wrapped kids movies - at least this has a touch of anarchy about it!  That said, I didn't laugh that much although I did enjoy the rough edges.,It is funny to see the cast now, although few of them have really gone on to become adults who did great things.  Astin is a little too drab for the film, his role has to carry the story whereas the others get to have more fun.  Feldman, Cohen and Ke Quan all get to enjoy themselves and are good value despite occasionally being more silly than funny.  The adult cast are much better and it is a shame that they aren't used that well - Davi, Pantoliano and Ramsey are all good and I would have preferred to have had more laughs from them.  Like the film itself, it's all very rough round the edges in terms of performances, which is both a good thing and a bad thing.,Overall I have not been won over to the extent that the army of Goonie fans are.  I enjoyed it even if I couldn't really get into either the comedy of the silly action.  It has it's moments and is probably best used to start and wean children off more childish stuff without making the jump right into adult films.",The Goonies,
Pathetic,"I hated this movie because it's just screaming without a plot. The kids have no empathy with the audience. The bandits do not scare anyone. One of the most important things you have in a kids movie it's the villain that must draw attention and be magnetic. Do The Gonnies have it? No! Not at all! Most critics here giving 7/10 upwards are just nostalgic freaks voting with childhood emotions. I fast forwarded after 30 minutes and kept doing until the end. It's inconceivable that people actually liked this movie. I read most comments giving 10/10 they are just saying the same thing ""oh my childhood, oh my childhood, oh it's a classic"". God! Please stop putting this garbage in a good rank! I don't like kids movies but you have so much better things out there that deserve much more ratings.",The Goonies,1
Mean-spirited pablum,"I still find it impossible to believe that some people consider this to be ""the movie of their childhood"". I saw it as totally mean-spirited (especially with the Spanish-only speaking au pair:  NO kids movie should allow kids to get away with tricking someone into thinking a house is loaded with sundry drugs/sexual torture devices that do not exist).,Whatever.",The Goonies,1
So many dick jokes...,"It's fair to say that Baywatch was never a great television show. Sure, it was popular but for reasons very different to it actually being a quality show. It was trashy as hell and combined slow-motion with a number of scantily clad supermodels running down the beach in bathing suits so no surprises at all that it attracted viewers. ,There seems to be a bit of a trend in reviving franchises that were popular back in the 80s and 90s, and right now, it was the turn of Baywatch. Quite why is something that I'm still scratching my head about.,When Mitch Buchanan (Dwayne Johnson) butts heads with new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron) over how to run Baywatch, they uncover a local criminal plot that threatens the future of the bay. ,As soon as the film started and we see Dwayne Johnson saving someone before Baywatch rises from the sea in giant letters behind him, I immediately thought this was going to be exactly what a Baywatch film should be if it was to be successful. A self aware comedy made as a parody of the show, in the same way that made the Jump Street films such a critical and financial success.,We get flashes of that formula however, for the most part, Baywatch is just an awful film. Painfully unfunny and not one memorable action sequence means it utterly fails as the action comedy it set out to be, and with a runtime of two hours it becomes one hell of a slog to sit through. ,I tried to enjoy it and take it for what it is but the problem is I just can't do that when there seems to be no effort into making the film funny, particularly when watching a comedy. Literally every other joke is a dick joke, including an overly long joke about one of the new recruits getting their dick stuck in a deck chair. I knew it was going to be silly and I didn't have high expectations at all but sadly they weren't even met.,Coming to the performances, Baywatch is absolutely lifeless. Even Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron, who has shown good comedic timing before, can't save this from becoming the absolute car wreck that it is. Alexandra Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach and Ilfenesh Hadera are sure nice to look at but the film fails them totally in giving them anything interesting to do, Daddario in particular who is actually quite a talented actress. Then there is Jon Bass who delivers an irritant of a performance as he hopelessly lusts after Rohrbach's CJ Parker. I felt embarrassed for them as they had to perform such a terrible script.,I won't even waste time in talking about the pathetic cameo that David Hasselhoff makes in the film. All I will say is what a waste of a cameo that had much better potential if they'd actually stopped to think about it. ,So there you have it, Baywatch is an awful film that fails as both an action and a comedy. It's already one of the worst films I've seen this year and I won't be surprised if it's still up there come the year's end.",Baywatch,2
Really depends on what you're looking for..,"Baywatch is super cheesy, low brow, campy, ridiculous, etc, etc.....but you know what? That's enjoyable sometimes! You don't knowingly buy a ticket to a movie like this and then go write a review afterwards complaining about plot, teenage boy humour, and character development. hahaha. I had low expectations, shut my brain off at the door, and enjoyed this movie for what it was.",Baywatch,8
I had to walk out in spite of really wanting to like this..,"The humor was sophomoric.. I can't believe some of the lines being delivered by the actors. I guess if you're getting paid millions you'll concede to saying anything. ,Could have been done so much better. Lazy writing. Lazy plot.. but I guess some audiences will fall for this. They will serve a certain demographic.. unfortunately it's not mine.",Baywatch,1
Awful,"I cannot believe I spent money to watch this movie in the cinema, this movie was awful. I went into the cinema expecting a comedy, but it turned out I actually went in to see an emotional character development journey with Zac Efron. It honestly was not worth it, all the funny parts of the movie can be seen in full in the trailers. I would rate the trailers 10/10 as they actually fooled me into thinking that this would be a good movie.",Baywatch,1
"Much like the show it's based on, this is STUPID!","A little over 20 years ago, the world was introduced to Baywatch the TV show. This was an awesome show for any pre-pubescent boy or middle aged pervert who liked to watch Pamela Anderson run in slow-mo. Much like the TV show, the film is all brawn and beauty and doesn't have a brain cell to its name. Starring Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne Johnson, the cast can't even save this atrocious excuse for a film. It is far from the comedic romp that was promised in the trailers. The film takes itself seriously and then other times it knows it is a parody. The only problem is, the filmmakers and writers can't decide on a tone. This really killed the film in more ways than one. Those who are expecting another Neighbors will be sorely disappointed and those of you wanting to see Dwayne Johnson kick some ass, you get to see that a little bit but there is much MUCH more to this film that could have been. I normally would go into a longer review and really talk about the film itself but I stopped myself short of this because any longer than this and it would simply be a waste of time, much like this film.",Baywatch,1
Writers are under-aged morons who have no clue about comedy,"When will Hollywood comedies of this decade hire writers who at least have a clue of comedy? Why hire immature morons who think the idea of a dick is funny and can replace a good script. Hollywood seems to be obsessed with male nudity and full frontal at that in this decade.If it is in the right context it could be funny but haven't seen one this decade. What happened to the writers of 40-year old virgin,knocked up,etc? This movie is a pathetic excuse for a comedy and is particularly sad since there was an opening for a new franchise which has been firmly grounded. Avoid if you are lucky and watch 'Central Intelligence' if you want to see the Rock in a good comedy!",Baywatch,2
"Almost everything in ""Baywatch"" is ridiculous and unfunny.","Fun fact: The original TV show ""Baywatch"" was cancelled after only one season. True story. Ratings for NBC's skin-tastic lifeguards-save-L.A. action-drama placed it in 73rd place out of 103 shows for the 1989-1990 television season and its studio (GTG) went out of business. But, as Norm McDonald used to remind us from the desk of SNL's Weekend Update, ""Germans LOVE David Hasselhoff."" (And people in lots of other countries do too!) Keeping the show from becoming a footnote in TV history, series star David Hasselhoff brought it to first-run syndication, where it ran from 1991-1999. Having become an international sensation, it then continued in a new setting, with a mostly new cast and under a new name, ""Baywatch Hawaii"", for two more seasons. Along the way, the show became a major part of the careers of Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, Yasmine Bleeth, Carmen Electra, Brooke Burns, Parker Stevenson and many others. Given the show's small screen stamina and enduring popularity, it seems natural that the TV show ""Baywatch"" would eventually become the movie ""Baywatch"" (R, 1:56), much like ""CHiPs"" earlier in 2017. Unfortunately, much like ""CHiPs"", the big screen ""Baywatch"" sucks.,On a Florida beach, Lt. Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) leads a group of lifeguards that he calls ""the elite of the elite"". Mitch himself has over 500 water rescues under his trunks, while teammates Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera) and C.J. Parker (Kelly Rohrbach) are similarly brave and skilled. In order to expand their team, Mitch and company hold try-outs for an additional three lifeguard slots. The new trainees end up being: the beautiful and brainy Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario), an awkward, out-of-shape but hard-charging nerd named Ronnie (Jon Bass) and Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a cocky, selfish 2-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming, who has since become persona non grata in the swimming world – and in society. (His new job somehow counts as community service for unspecified legal trouble.) As Ronnie harbors a not-so-secret crush on C.J., and Brody flirts with Summer, training commences. Brody has to learn what it is to be a real team player and that there is more to being a lifeguard than just being able to swim fast. Meanwhile, a local police officer (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), Mitch's supervisor (Rob Huebel), and even Brody, want Mitch to learn that he is a lifeguard – NOT a cop.,The reason that Mitch and the other lifeguards feel the need to act like cops is found in the person of Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra from TV's ""Quantico""). She's the new owner of a bayside resort called The Huntley Club and it looks like she's up to no good. We hear her accused of running drugs and she doesn't deny it. We see her colluding with a city councilman (Oscar Nuñez) on some real estate deal and see bribes him with an expensive watch. We understand that Mitch doesn't trust her and she invites him to a party. At this ""meet the neighbors"" gathering, Mitch and company do their best to dig up some dirt to back up their suspicions, but Leeds is a wily woman and proof is harder to find than body fat on Dwayne Johnson or Zac Efron. When packets of a dangerous designer drug pop up, plus a suspicious fire and a couple of corpses, naturally it's up to a few lifeguards to solve the mystery, right? That's what the Baywatch babes and boys think anyway. And that's just part of what's wrong here.,""Baywatch"" is mostly ridiculous and unfunny. What passes for character development are back stories which raise more questions than they answer. What passes for acting are one-dimensional characterizations which aren't believable or even sensical. And what passes for humor basically falls into one of three categories: references to the areas of the human body usually covered by swim suits, vomit jokes and seeing how many pop culture references Mitch can come up with to insult young pretty boy Brody (although some were funny) – and the best gags are all in the theatrical trailers. The screenplay, by writing partners Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, puts the characters in situations which are more insulting to the intelligence of the average Movie Fan than they are humorous. Seth Gordon's direction is too weak to make sense of it all or to give the audience more than a few chuckles along the way.,The acting is across-the-board bad, but the worst of the worst is a tie between Bass, for simply doing a 2-hour Josh Gad impression, and Chopra, for showing nowhere near the gravitas or menace necessary to be an effective villain with a (dis)honorable mention to the usually entertaining Johnson, who ends up in his worst role since 2013's ""Pain & Gain"". For a few amusing moments and for poking self-aware fun at its source material, the film scores minor points, but it basically can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a parody or a drama and it doesn't do any of those very well. (But don't gloat Dax Shepherd. ""CHiPs"" made most of the same mistakes.) ""Baywatch"" would be better titled ""No Way Watch"". This movie is as lame as that pun I just made. In a mid-credits scene, Johnson talks sequel with a cast member from the original TV show. Don't hold your breath, Dwayne. Consider your movie fortunate to get out of this review with a ""D+"".",Baywatch,1
Awful,"It seems like the studio is trying to inflate the reviews, and now I know why. The movie is not funny at all, don't waste your money. The worst part was when Efron touches a dead man's genitals, disturbing uncomfortable and unnecessary. ,The only good thing is the cameo of Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff, but just look for the clips on youtube and you will be totally fine.",Baywatch,1
"Washed Up, Dead on Arrival.","Comedy is dead. Baywatch has made me lose any hope of any movie being funny in 2017. If this is the best Hollywood can do, they are done for.,There is no inspiration or creativity to be found. The idea is: Hey, 21 Jump Street was hilarious! What would happen if we did the same thing for (fill in the blank)? 21 Jump Street was one of the rare occasions where a TV-adaptation film was worth seeing, and ultimately, ended up being better than the source material. What was Baywatch originally? A horrible TV show in the 80's. It existed only to show off the glistening, bouncing, beautiful bodies of it's lead actors David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. There isn't much material to make a film off of. That is, unless, the filmmakers went nuts and turned the source material into an absurd farce.. lets say of the Will Ferrel variety. Instead, Baywatch 2017 is a lopsided, painfully stupid, unbearably dull, cringe- inducing insult to the intelligence of the filmgoing public. Pain and Gain had more nuanced humor. Mike and Dave was the funnier Zac Efron movie. Let that sink it.,I might have said, ""This makes no sense"", out-loud in the movie theater about 10 times. They made a film completely out of action-comedy clichés, strung together incoherently. The big laugh set- pieces are desperate. One joke in particular is a genital mishap lifted directly from ""There's Something About Mary"". That joke is 20-years old. If you're going to be a thief, at least steal something timely. The cast might be the only positive thing I can note. They are all really charming, and sexy to look at, but at what cost?,I couldn't think of a worse film to be slated for Memorial Day weekend. This is going to be a long, hot summer of Hollywood failures.",Baywatch,2
Cringeworthy Childish Humour,"For the first time I actually walked out of a film before the end. ,The humour is infantile, so stupid I was embarrassed for the actors. ,This film is just beautiful bodies wandering about hoping it makes an entertaining film. ,Clear proof you can't make a silk purse, no matter how many beautiful people you use, out of a rotting, festering, maggot ridden pigs ear written by talentless chimps. ,Complete waste of time and money 0.5/10,Suspicious of the many 10/10 ratings, given by first time reviewers/new reviewers. Confirms suspicions Studios try to promote their films with bogus reviews.",Baywatch,1
A Nice summer comedy with lots of jokes,"I had a really great time watching this movie and I am quite glad I chose it over the Pirates of the Caribbean. There are lots of nice jokes and contrary to my initial thoughts, there are very few nude scenes. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Effron are both great leads and they inarguably take part in all the funny scenes of the movie. ,I have to admit that I was quite cautious before going to see the movie due to all the negative reviews and I finally came to a conclusion about all the people who believe that every movie should be reviewed as a potential Oscar nominee! Not all movies have to be ""serious"" and dramatic. I know most of the reviewers out there were expecting to see something like ""The Pianist"" when they bought tickets for ""Baywatch"" and that is the reason why this movie let them down. My advice is to watch movies that make you have a nice time (Baywatch is one of them alongside Piranha 3D, American Pie). Not all movies are filmed in order to become Oscar Nominees! Many of them are made with the goal of making the viewers have a great time! Please take that into account the next time you are criticizing a movie!",Baywatch,9
An amazing movie with quality comedy,"Honestly, I am not sure why people are bagging on this film. Its great. The plot is fun, and runs smoothly. The comedy in this film is what sells it the most. Some of the jokes are actually great and unexpected. The others, are cheesy, on purpose, and will make you laugh regardless. Dwayne Johnson knocks it out of the park on this one. All of the cast has character, and none of them are neglected. It's a great film. I'd recommend it to everybody. Don't listen to the useless critics and pointless user reviewers with super over the top movie standards. If you wanna relax and laugh, watch this film. If you want to come in with a microscope and over analyze something in a way it wasn't meant to be analyzed, just don't come to not ruin it for others.",Baywatch,10
Unpopular opinion : I enjoyed it,"While there were a few issues that I made this movie less good, this is a decent blockbuster that's extremely entertaining.,I was extremely hyped for this movie and was expecting much. Overall, most of those expectations were met.,A strong point of the movie is the jokes. One reviewer on the site seems to think there were too many dick jokes. Here is my response. If you watch and enjoy dumb comedies like ""This is the end"", ""Why Him?"" or ""The Hangover"", this is no different and you will laugh a lot. I laughed a lot at 90% of the jokes. They didn't fall flat. ,Another really good part of the movie is the action. There are some really good action scenes that are beautifully shot. They are really well done. While not on Fast & Furious 8 level, we do get some great one liners.,Baywatch was in general a pretty shallow movie when it comes to the story, but one part of it was really good : Brody's character development. While I may have been one of the few, I was engaged in his character. He's a mess and he needs a place to belong.,The main strong point of the movie was the heart. Not many movies are able to have a team that's awesome and sticks together like in this movie. This gave the movie heart and made it very fun to watch. This is enhanced by some pretty good performances by The Rock, Zac Efron and Alexandra Daddario.,Now, for the aspects of the movie I didn't like so much, the story. While the action and other good aspects compensate, the story was weak. It was like a weak episode of NCIS. The suspense wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for one thing : the fact that the characters are playing catch up with us when it should be the other way around. We already see what the bad guys have done and it takes away the suspense. It was really predictable. ,Like I said, this movie was hilarious but too many good jokes were seen in the trailer. Even the scene of Brody and Mitch kissing was released before the movie was out which is really disappointing. This happens often in comedies.,I've never watched the Baywatch TV show and that's probably why I enjoyed this movie. IT was funny and had good action scenes and heart. If you're a fan of ""This is the end"" like comedies, definitely don't miss this one.",Baywatch,8
Don't listen to these stupid bad reviews!,"This film has had so many bad reviews and I honestly don't have a clue why. I went to see this film yesterday with my mates and we absolutely loved it! It had so much to offer, funny and entertaining from beginning to end. The acting was fantastic and the actors in this really know how to keep you entertained. ,The film was hilarious, action packed, very sexy and the story line was brilliantly planned out. The way you have to follow the character of Matt Brody played by Zac Efron is great and makes you want to stay and see what happens. At the end of the day these bad reviews and scores this film is getting really confuses me, this is the best film I have seen in such a long time and I can't wait for Baywatch 2!",Baywatch,10
It's not a James Bond movie!,"It's not a James Bond movie, but the drama is real!,Let's be totally honest - the movie is exactly as it's supposed to be. It's light, slightly offensive (to whoever it can) and sends this wink to the audience. Not like Deadpool completely breaking the 4th wall. In a way that keeps with the summer vibe.,Definitely, a summer movie to watch with friends on a hot evening with a glass of Pimms!,Lupierz",Baywatch,8
Great looking and funny cast.  Plot is secondary but that's not the point anyway....,"Mitch and his crew protect a crime ridden beach, encountering murder, drug dealing, blackmail and romance. Brody is perfectly cast and played by Zac Efron, as washed up ""vomit comet"" Olympic swimmer (Ryan Lochte esque) who blows his career by vomiting in the pool during the Olympic relay. Now he finds himself down on his luck, offered a job on a reluctant Mitch's lifeguard crew. Mitch challenges young Brody with inventive belittling nicknames and endurance course antics. It is an amazing thing to see the fitness challenge between the equally impressive Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Somehow, I really believe they could carry two refrigerators on their shoulders. Ronnie is a new character actor, and is incredibly funny as the ""IT"" lifeguard recruit and love interest of ""slow mo"" hot girl with daddy issues CJ. Priyanka Chopra does not quite hit the mark as the gorgeous villain who is buying up beachfront and running a drug empire. Still, the cast appear to have had great fun and good chemistry in the filming of this movie. The theatre I attended was full and there was plenty of spontaneous laughing throughout. I love this kind of humour, no it's not high brow and the plot has holes but it's so much fun to watch. Recommend!",Baywatch,8
Laugh a minute,"Absolute laugh a minute, don't take it too seriously and you'll love it! Having seen the old Baywatch the two aren't really comparable and thats the point, they're not meant to be similar, this is a complete throw your brain away popcorn movie and that is what it should be judged on!",Baywatch,10
Loved It!,"Loved This Movie!!!! It was hilarious with non-stop laughs and a lot of great one-liners. Too many people are trying to turn it into what it's not. It's a comedy and delivers on that front. Didn't feel like it needed a deeper story line because that isn't the purpose of the movie. ,Would totally recommend this to anyone and would love to see it again!",Baywatch,10
Laughing is this movies goal.,"For what it is worth, it is a good movie. Plenty of decent jokes. Some vulgar jokes but very few. Some awkward jokes as well. I did enjoy it and so will you. Just a genuine movie for good laughs. The sense of humor this movie calls for is not for everyone. Still, you can enjoy this movie and I hope you do. It will not become one of your classic movies though; it is not that kind of humor at all.",Baywatch,9
Not A Single Fart Joke Was Given!,"I am forty-six years old and I'll be one of the first decry Hollywood's descent into 'nothing but potty humor' notions of what passes for comedy these days. Also, having been seventeen when the show first aired I can tell you that the gratuitous shots of bouncing breasts in slow motion we're not nearly as prevalent as people remember, in what little I saw of it. That said, I am absolutely dumbfounded by the negative reviews and poor opening of this film! I can't help but wonder what in the world people were expecting. To be fair, I may have watched about five episodes of the TV show when it was on, but my assumption was that the show was about a group of lifeguards getting into situations and capers well outside the purview of a group of lifeguards. For me, this movie was practically perfect at being what it set out to be. It never tried to take itself too seriously, yet was only just campy enough to let the audience know that. I thought everyone performed well in their given roles, the jokes were hilarious and no more excessive than what I would expect the 2017, rated 'R' film version to pull off. At times I even felt like I was in the middle of a seasons long binge on Netflix. This movie did a decent job of making the outlandish 'not-so-mysterious mystery' somewhat believable and I even half-expected a scene near the end with Priyanka Chopra's villain saying, 'And I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling lifeguards and your bigger, stronger Hasselhoff!' Now as a disclaimer, this was the first 'R' rated movie I took my teen-aged son to see so I thought perhaps my laugh meter was ratcheted up, but the theater that was 85% full at 9:20PM on a Sunday night all seemed to be laughing as hard as we were. I think perhaps people were just upset with this film for having not enough naked women and sexual situations, or contrarily didn't want their Baywatchers using foul language and making penis jokes? I don't know. I say go see this movie with zero expectations, let it be what it is, don't be a prude, and you will laugh a lot and have a good time!",Baywatch,9
Truly the best!,"Baywatch was brought back to life on the big screen after the most successful TV show in the early nineteen nineties. The show castes David Hasselhoff as Mitch Buchannon, and Pamela Anderson as one of the beautiful Baywatch babes, C. J. Parker. The movie in turn, has made people around the world feel ecstatic, heartfelt, and sometimes even anxious. In addition, several of the actors showed us each of the iconic characters in a whole new light. The movie starred Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson(as Mitch Buchannon), Zac Efron(as Matt Broody), Alexandra Daddario(as Summer Quinn), Jon Bass(as Ronnie), Ilfenesh Hadera(as Stephanie Holden), and Kelly Rohrbach(as C.J. Parker). The Hoff himself does a short cameo, along with Pamela Anderson in the film. In the first part of the movie, you see Mitch running alongside the ocean, watching everyone with eyes like a hawk. He stays calm, cool, and collect. However, Mitch still sticks to his job in a very serious manner ensuring, everything is as it should be, but with a warm touch. Later on, he gets even more assertive, as he has to deal with the brand new recruit Matt Broody, who thinks he is hot stuff because of his skill set, or the lack of. Matt Broody tries to get by with a half hearten work ethic, but fails miserably. All the while, having no knowledge of what a lifeguard is all about, and the never ending drinking habit. During which the offer lifeguards see him as some kind punk wanna be, trying to impress them. When instead, he proves he is just a total lazy butt, who craves everyone's attention. As the movie progresses, Mitch becomes more reluctant about having Matt on their team knowing he will just drop the ball again. The other lifeguards such as, Summer Quinn and Stephanie Holden even object him for a while. Broody has no respect for women, or what they do on a day to day basis to save their beach. Near the end though, he has a change of heart once he realizes the issue is much bigger than himself. I felt like the actors did an amazing job portraying their roles on screen. I definitely noticed how each character developed throughout the movie. I was also impressed with how the director, Seth Gordon, the whole crew, as well as the cast stuck to the story line the entire flick. The movie flowed smoothly from beginning to end. Also, Vaywatch had a very good message to give to the audience. Which it consists of looking out for your team, but doing it the right way, even if you have to go out of your comfort zone. In conclusion, I recommend Baywatch for people ages seventeen and older. There is language throughout, nudity, and crude adult content.",Baywatch,10
Loved every minute of it!,"I have not laughed so hard in such a longtime. Baywatch has a phenomenal cast and everything you'd want out of a comedy. I recommend this to everyone, except maybe the little ones. The entire theater was laughing their butts off, I could barely breathe!,This isn't a serious story driven movie, and if you can't handle jokes, this movie is not for you.,It didn't even feel like a 2 hour movie, which is a good thing.,Could be considered a spoiler I suppose:,My favorite scene is in the beginning (The Beach chair), if you've seen the movie you understand what I am referring too.",Baywatch,10
Forget the haters,"Just watch it for yourself. I was drawn in by Amy Pohler, someone I didn't really like before I saw this show, and i stayed because of the beautifully drawn characters. Because they're deep characters, they're not gonna slam you over the head with comedy. This ain't My Name Is Earl, people. The show's funny, but in a real, get to know everyone kind of way.,Even though I loved it, I'd say the first season stumbled a bit, but the second season gets funnier with every episode. Try it out, I bet you'll like one character right off the bat, and if you're like me you'll end up loving them all.",Parks and Recreation,10
I don't know what these other reviews are talking about!,"While extremely predictable, Baywatch lives up to what comedies are offering the viewers of today's society: laughs! Lots of laughs! There are the generic breast and penis jokes, lots of butt and boob close ups, but also genuine hilarity. ,The men and women at my movie theater couldn't stop laughing. In fact, I had to cover my mouth several times from laughing TOO loudly. There are moments of warmth, lessons to be learned, and a lot of Zac Efron's abs. ,With the amount of ladies' butts shown in this movie, it rivals the latest Fast and Furious movie. I also feel that the people who wrote reviews who say they got up to leave in the middle, or thirty minutes in, sorely missed out on a wonderful film. Don't listen to the critics, go see this film!",Baywatch,8
So Funny!,"Baywatch was such a funny movie and is probably going to be the best movie of the whole summer. This movie keeps you entertained the entire time and again is so funny. I have never seen the original show so I have nothing to compare it to but it reminds me of something like 21 Jump Street. Throughout the film there is lots of action which is exciting and all the actors and actresses do an excellent job! Ignore the critics and go and watch Baywatch, I have actually already pre ordered a digital copy I liked this movie so much! I hope more people watch it so they go and make a second film. If you don't watch this you are really going to miss out!!!",Baywatch,10
This is the reason I made IMDb ACCOUNT!   #1 comedy of year for me so far!!,While buying tickets ahead of time for Wednesday showing I though this movie was going to be not so good but enjoyable. I was wrong this movie is heck a lot of fun Dwayne Johnson was incredible so was Zac and you even get good looking girls who also play good not just for the looks. This movie also has SPOILER *cameos* that were a good surprise. Me never watching the show and going to hopefully have a chance to soon go to theaters to see BAYWATCH very well worth seeing..,Baywatch,10
Funniest show on TV (surprisingly),"I was lukewarm on this show throughout the first season and for the beginning of the second, but the last few episodes have made this the funniest show on air for me. The humor is not always laugh out loud, but I can watch each episode a few times and find new things that make me laugh each time. ,The mayor is one of the funniest characters I've ever seen on a show, and April the intern is funny even when she isn't saying anything. Some of the cameos aren't very funny, but all of the basic elements are fantastic and improving each episode. The Office seems to be (very slowly) running out of steam but this show is definitely making up for it. ,There's quite a few bad reviews for this show, but I can't suggest it enough. It is the opposite type of humor from My Name is Earl (which it replaced), and I consider that a very good thing.",Parks and Recreation,10
Cute Where The Office is Awkward,"This show is basically a cute version of The Office. If you haven't seen The Office, it is a hilarious show that is filmed like a documentary. It has a weird vibe because all of the characters seem to know that the cameras are there. They also give asides to the camera which are always funny. The asides in Parks and Recreation are funnier than those from The Office. They seem to be more of a showcase for the actors to show off their comedy, not additions to the plot. ,One thing that turns some people off about The Office (that is to say, what sets it apart from other shows), is that it gets incredibly and hilariously awkward. What sets Parks and Recreation apart is that it is incredibly and hilariously cute. Where The Office makes your jaw drop before you burst into laughter, Parks and Recreation gives you a warm smile before you burst into laughter. It makes it a lot of fun to watch.,Another subtle difference from The Office is that aside from Jerry (Parks and Recreation's version of The Office's Toby), is that all of the characters care deeply about one another.,The cast of Parks and Recreation is far better than the admittedly stellar cast of The Office. Amy Poehler lights up the screen every time she is in view. Rashida Jones has much better on screen chemistry with this cast than she ever did during her stint on The Office. This show is incredibly lucky to have Aziz Ansari before he becomes a worldwide phenomenon, because he is well on his way. Don't even get me started on how perfect Nick Offerman plays his role as the motivated slacker, libertarian boss. ,In the end the haters will say, ""Oh they just stole The Office's idea and put it in City Hall."" That is a far to shallow of a response to such a deeply funny show that stands wonderfully on its own.",Parks and Recreation,10
"Very endearing, while absolutely hilarious!","There is no doubt that one of the main inspirations of this show was The Office - you will realise this in the first minute of the first episode. However, instead of trying to copy the main points of that show's success, Parks and Recreation has come up with its very own recipe. Amy Poehler is amazing as the lead actress, she plays an extremely enthusiastic city official in a department filled with bludgers and lazy bums.,What sounds a little lame actually becomes very endearing very quickly: all supporting characters have great story-lines, and grow quickly with a light yet sometimes strangely moving plot. The dialogue is fantastic, every show will make you laugh out loud plenty of times, and the roughly 20 minutes of each episode are over way too quickly.,I found myself re-watching the whole two seasons immediately after I had finished them for the first time, and the show holds up easily. Each character gets enough screen time to stay interesting, and very quickly, the show establishes a Simpsons-like range of in-jokes and extras who add even more depth to the story.,Before you know it, you wish your own city had such a department, and you will fall in love with Amy Poehler's stellar performance. An absolute must-watch!",Parks and Recreation,10
Really Good Stuff,"I'm surprised at how many people wrote negative reviews of this show despite it being my most-looked forward comedy of the week, followed by the Office, Curb, Sunny in Phily, and the Peep Show - a great British comedy. ,The characters are unique and the comedy comes mostly from subtleties such as intonations, gestures, and camera glances. It's high-end comedic stuff in my opinion. Though Arrested Development was untouchable in this regard. Boy AD was good. ,I suppose if you like trite predicable comedy, you wouldn't see it as funny, but the thing about this show is that's it's also fun to watch, the characters are very charismatic on screen, I think the casting was great. Is this 10 lines yet IMDb?,A really great show.",Parks and Recreation,9
Better Each Time I Watch!,"There was a lot of anticipation for Amy Poehler's new series, at least around here there was, and after eagerly tuning in to the pilot episode and every episode since then, I can honestly say that it has lived up to my expectations! ,Parks and Recreation has a sort of dry humor, where the really funny parts are the awkward moments between Leslie (Amy's character) and other characters. It is truly Amy's strong point, as we saw during her (too short!) run on SNL and in movies like ""Blades of Glory"" and ""Baby Mamma"". Amy absolutely steals the show, but it might be just because that's how the show has been written; the supporting cast are all strong actors, and, with the right material, could all bring in huge laughs for the show.,It is obvious when watching ""Parks and Recreation"" that there has been a lot of effort put forth to put out a great show, and I believe they have pulled it off. The show leaves me not only laughing hysterically but also rooting for Leslie and her committee. The show is a welcome addition to my weekly TV schedule, and is worth checking out more than once.",Parks and Recreation,10
"Fantastic, A Classic In My Book","There are always a few television shows that seem to ""define"" a genre every decade or so, and considering Parks and Recreation finished its final run several months ago, I feel it important to revisit the show and the impact it left. Many times it was spurned as ""The Office Rip-Off"" in its starting days, despite it being more of a brainchild of the writers than anything. It seems safe to say, that after more than seven years on the air, Parks and Recreation has carved its own spot amongst the quirky and well-loved comedies that are hard to come across today.,The show stars hard-working public servant Leslie Knope (played by the amazing Amy Poehler) and a cast of humorous and memorable characters that navigate through bureaucracy and red tape in the local city government to complete projects. The most notable--and perhaps most powerful--asset of this show is its lovable and unforgettable characters, some that will leave you rolling your eyes and chuckling while others will simply make you smile in the most joyous kind of way. The cast has obvious chemistry amongst one another, and this certainly breaks through into the characters in ways that will make a viewer grow more attached to them. ,The humor of the show itself also sets Parks and Rec apart from other television shows. While it's apparent the first season struggled to differentiate itself from The Office's ""awkward humor"", Parks found its stride in the simple ""cute humor"", the kind that is so innocuous and dumb and simply ""cute"" that it becomes hard not to laugh at the bumbling antics of the Parks and Recreation branch of the city of Pawnee. The episodes are mixed with the right amount of comedy, wit, and actual drama and storytelling; each character is crafted with the perfect amount of depth, that really separates from other comedy shows that rely on cardboard characters with running jokes to spew the funny. Even in its heartfelt moments, there is always room for laughs, but it never pushes aside the rest of the characters or their development. If you find yourself immersed in Parks and Recreation, it is almost certain you will find yourself immersed with one, more, or maybe all characters.,The simple genius, the style and passion this show was borne of, really marks it as a one-of-a-kind show, one that may not have had all the high ratings or prime-time slots or huge important newspaper reviews, but it became its own, and that's really what mattered in the end. After struggling in the shadow of The Office, and finding its stride in later seasons, Parks and Recreation became its own kind of wonderful recipe, one that delivered its own style of warmth and humor not found in many television shows. It may even define the style of comedy itself; after all, both Parks and The Office made famous the ""mockumentary"", ""talking heads"" sort of humor that others are sure to try and replicate. What gave Parks and Recreation a ""name"" per say, is the fact that the characters were so much larger-than-life, the stories so innocuous and believable, that the avid viewer can begin to believe them too, and find that this show is as heartfelt, funny, and enjoyable as I found it. 10/10",Parks and Recreation,10
Brilliantly Hilarious -- and Hilariously Brilliant!  Fantastic!,"I've been a big fan of Amy Poehler ever since she played Andy Richter's pigtailed, dental-retainered little sister (with the huge crush on Conan!) on Conan O'Brien's late night show. That first appearance is still the most amazing performance I've ever seen on TV. The addled but adorable Leslie Knope is the absolutely IDEAL character for Amy to play! I'm also thrilled to see Rashida Jones, another of my favorite super-talents, doing a thoroughly delicious characterization as Ann Perkins. Word was that the network was worried about the similarity to The Office. What's to worry? Two genius shows just might be better than one!!! The writing on this show is breathtakingly original and deeply enjoyable. You won't find a better cast anywhere on Earth. This is just another case of ""a perfect storm"" of comedy excellence on NBC -- along with The Office and 30 Rock. It's well known that the best TV comedy derives from complex, fascinating characters. Along with the creators and scribes of those other two shows, these writers are the absolute best at devising characters that are equally lovable and horrifying -- you can totally revel in their triumphs AND their tragedies!",Parks and Recreation,10
Very Funny,"I never saw the first few episodes which I intend to get to at some point. Got into Parks and Recreation somewhere in the middle of the first season. It has quickly become one of my favorite shows on television. Up there next to Family Guy. I never really got into Amy Poehler's humor on SNL, but Parks and Recreation showed me just how talented she really is. She is an incredible comedic actress, her timing and expression are dead on and she is sooo cute! I'm glad her talent is showcased so well on Parks and Recreation. The other actors on the show aren't too shabby either. Very talented people on this show, Nick Offerman, Paul Schneider, Aubrey Plaza, and Chris Pratt are my other favorites. And yes, it is ""laugh out loud"" kind of funny. It is smart humor too. Great characters, great stories. I can't wait to see how it develops.",Parks and Recreation,10
Outstanding supporting cast nearly sunk by Poehler's Knope,"First off, I watched every episode of every season. This is not some hit piece, but a thought-out explanation of what was rubbing me wrong this whole time... rubbed raw by the end of it.,The comparisons to The Office are fine and well, especially in the first two season, but those two seasons were actually the best in the series... should have stuck with what worked. First the good: nearly ever single major supporting cast member. Pratt was Fantastic and lovable. Plaza was good weird. Ansari took many episodes and made them epic, especially whenever Ben Schwartz and Jenny Slate were involved. Ansari and Retta were also perfect together (treat yourself). Rashida Jones was the girl everyone wants to marry in real life. Rob Lowe eventually got going and really had some good moments, I never knew how funny he could be; his new DirectTv commercials take what he mastered in Parks and Rec to a whole new level. There are so many other supporting actors no one will read this if I list each one... so onwards and downwards.,Now the bad. The root of all issues lie with Leslie Knope, but I will come back to her character in a moment. Jerry/Gary/Larry - love this guy and how Jim O'Heir played him, I wish he was in my family... now why all the putrid bullying? If this character was a woman would anyone stand for this? It was out of left field many times with no reason given, just wrong. I thought maybe they were trying to find a ""Toby"" character to beat up on, but unlike Toby Gary/Jerry/Larry did NOTHING wrong EVER aside from being clumsy. It was strange and I think if the character was played by an overweight woman someone would have lost their job over the meanness of it all, what a double standard. Just go back and watch some of the bullying of him and mentally replace him with an overweight woman, you will see what I am saying.,Ben Wyatt. I have been a fan of Adam Scott since Party Down, and I think he did a good job here... but again Leslie Knope. The closer his character got to the Knope character the more emasculated he became, by the end there was no doubt who wore the pantsuit and who wore the pants. Too bad, I liked the board game obsession, the smart quirkiness, the general unique qualities to his character. It seemed all stripped away by the end and he was just some odd political husband without meaning. Also the entire romance was so unbelievable, absolutely zero chemistry.,Ron Swanson. He was great, Nick Offerman was great. The storytelling was awful. Ron is supposed to be the Anti-Knope. The libertarian/conservative reasonableness to the progressive pushings of Leslie Knope. But in every single standoff Ron Swanson gives in to his values and bends to Knope's wishes because she ""really believes"" or ""really fights"" or ""really tries"" to do something. I am sorry, but if you believe in the opposite of someone else, just because they are ""really trying"" hard doesn't mean you forsake all of your own beliefs. This was no more evident than the end when he gives in to Knope one last time to work for the Federal Government to essentially be a park Ranger. The Ron Swanson I would have liked to see would have somehow finagled the land from the Federal Government and opened up his own Wilderness park to teach kids not to be such sissies and depend on themselves and each other for survival, all the while respecting what he loves most... nature.,So let's get this over with... Leslie Knope was the biggest bully of them all. She bullied every single character to do her bidding, relentlessly, degradingly, sometimes with a smile, sometimes with a tantrum, sometimes in ""their"" best interest... but it got annoying real fast. If the series would have shifted away from her as a central character and instead someone they all had to deal with, that would have been ideal and would have let the truly exceptional characters shine. I could handle the antics 5 minutes an episode, way too many other characters I would have preferred seeing.,Keeping the Knope character in the spotlight quickly turned this series (which would have been great with the true ineptitude of government bureaucracies as a backdrop for hilarious people doing hilarious things) to a huge progressive love-fest with every progressive cliché and politician making a cameo.,Towards the end (seasons 6-7) it was very formulaic writing and was basically reduced to a bunch of small skits to get each one's shtick in, absolutely no effort or thought was put in to the overall story. The giant take away is that government rules best when ruled by people who really want to rule you...",Parks and Recreation,4
Awesome,"So far, since there's only been three episodes of the show, it's been pretty great. The third episode has definitely been the funniest so far, i feel like it's going to gain momentum and really prove to be just as funny as it's cousin ""The Office."" P&R has gotten generally positive reviews, and as for the negatives i say let the show grow. it's only been THREE episodes, ""The Office"" was NOT an instant classic if you all recall, it was on the chopping block a few times (and also had to try and crawl out of the massive shadow of it's brilliant British original). Amy Poehler is one of the funniest comedians right now and deserves her own time to really shine. Aziz, from the hysterical one-season sketch show Human Giant, is definitely a scene stealer, as well as Poheler's scowling, anti-government boss. It's got all the right ingredients to become another comedy gem. Give it a chance, relax, and let the best Thursday night (8:30-10) line-up on NBC pump you full of awe-smacking awesome. oh, and lighten up ;)",Parks and Recreation,8
Not what it used to be,"I browsed through the reviews, probably seeking a reinforcement of my opinion that the show has lost its previous charm. Most of the reviews are pretty old, so I still don't know if it's just me.,I must start by saying that I loved the first seasons, with the often awkward and politically incorrect Leslie. I loved ""the Office"" type of humor, but done more humanely and with a lot more charm.,In the latter seasons I noticed that they began transforming Leslie from the often inadequate and clueless leader to a model to all women and girls alike. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but now the jokes are not quite the same, I do not recognize the character and from my point of view the humor has taken a bit hit.I cannot help but feel a little betrayed.,On the other hand, there are characters that, instead of benefiting from some minor changes which could make them less annoying, they are actually devolving: Andy Dwyer is such an example. How much more stupid are they going to make him? And April - her passive-aggressive and detached behavior has transformed into pure aggressivity aimed at Ann Perkins, most of the time for no good reason at all. I do not find that funny.,Perhaps people still like the show as it is today, maybe more. But for me, while I do like to see some evolution in the characters, as one cannot laugh at the same things over and over again, I do not appreciate when they do a complete 180... Or when their negative traits are exaggerated more and more until they lose any humanity they might have had.,The first two seasons would get a 10 from me, but as it is, I settle on a 6.",Parks and Recreation,6
A rare gem,"Parks and Recreation is a rare gem in the comedy business. There is never a dull moment.,Parks and Rec is highly amusing and addictive to watch. You won't be able to stop watching after you watch the first few episodes! The story line is funny and full of plot twists. With seven seasons you are sure in for a ride!,I rate this a 9 out of 10",Parks and Recreation,9
Does not live up to the hype (spoilers),"For starters, I've had big expectations of this show but in the end I was disappointed. First season reminded me of Modern Family (because of the shooting style, camera zooming in and out)and Leslie kind of resembled Phil Dunphy from M. Family. The second season was hilarious, especially the first couple of episodes but basically I've had a lot of laughs during 2nd season.,From 3rd season things started to go downhill and seasons 4, 5 and 6 were just getting worse by each episode. Leslie's character evolved to a control-freaky, clingy, bossy and over the top caring persona in a very annoying way. All the scrap-booking and special gifts for special occasions and basically every day was a special occasion / anniversary of something trivial and mundane just made me think that I would never like to have a friend like that in my life. April became obnoxious although she was my favorite character in the first two seasons. Ann dating Tom was just pointless and unconvincing.,Regarding Ann, she annoyed the hell out of me during her pregnancy, I was kind of relieved when Rashida Jones left the show. Also, Ben and Leslie are not believable as a couple, there's no chemistry between them and often times I felt sorry for Ben as he was constantly bullied by Leslie's overzealous dedication to work. The characters basically became caricatures of themselves. After the Pawnee / Eagleton merger things got too absurd for my taste and I didn't like the new characters. I really don't get why this series got such high ratings and excellent reviews. I give it a 5 because I liked the 2nd season and 'cause it had a few funny moments later on, but even this rating is a bit of a stretch.",Parks and Recreation,5
Easy and  fun to watch,"I really loved this series. The thing is that I tried to start watching it a couple years ago and I hated it.. I watched like 2 episodes. Out of the blue I decided to give a second chance I finished all seasons in 2 weeks. ,I really liked it because is was really easy to watch, no complicated a story just a really funny down to earth comedy.,In terms of the end, well I got mixed feelings but it was not horrible, but definitely better compared to The Office. For some reason I thought that Michael Scott or Dwight were going to pop up at any moment for some reason. Ron rules ! Tammy, this is Diane. Diane this is a piece of human garbage named Tammy, who is also my ex-wife.""",Parks and Recreation,10
Amy Poehler's Great!,"I have been a Saturday Night Live fan for too long. I like Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, an idealistic parks and recreational director, for Pawnee, Indiana. The show is based about the parks and recreation department in a small Midwestern town. Amy Poehler should be on the list for Emmy nominees for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. She shines as Leslie Knope. I only wished that Lorne Michaels would start developing sitcoms with his Saturday Night Live alumni like Poehler and Tina Fey. It's worth the investment and we need to laugh in times like this more than ever. The show has a quirky, offbeat sense of humor and a supporting cast that doesn't seem familiar yet but I'm sure I'll recognize them in time. Anyway, guest stars like Megan Mullally is worth watching.",Parks and Recreation,8
I can count on one hand the number of shows that make me laugh out loud when I am watching alone and this is one of them.,"I started Parks and Rec from a recommendation since I love the Office. I was hesitant at first because it seemed like it was almost a rip off with the whole fake-documentary style comedy where characters break the fourth wall and speak to the camera (and thus, the audience), and it does take place in a different kind of office: the Parks and Recreation department for a town called Pawnee, Indiana. ,But let me tell you, I was wrong. I found I enjoyed this show just as much as the Office. While the style was similar, the characters make this show so enjoyable. Every single character is so well developed, unique, and funny. They are caricatures of different people that we all have in our lives, and yet each one has qualities that make you like them. Unlike the Office, you don't have to worry about secondhand embarrassment/super uncomfortable situations, which is a plus. ,Parks and Recreation is a show that you will find yourself quoting constantly, which to me is it's own metric of success in anything that I watch. And as the title of this review states: it will have you laughing out loud like an idiot even if you're watching by yourself. Parks and Recreation is fresh, original, funny, and has some great emotional moments even though the circumstances are sometimes outrageous. I will admit that I teared up over a memorial concert for a mini-horse called ""Lil' Sebastian"". There is also some really great satire for anyone interested in politics, or like myself, has little time for politics. Either way, the comedy there is undeniable. ,As an aside, for any Chris Pratt fans out there like myself, this is a good show to watch for him alone (though as I mentioned before, all of the characters are great), and it's really neat to watch because he does transform physically throughout the show because he clinched Guardians of the Galaxy towards the end of the series (in case you are like me and enjoy that sort of tidbit). ,Highly recommend.",Parks and Recreation,10
Hilarious show with a great ending tribute,Parks and Recreation is a funny show that started out slow but tuned into a hit sitcom that was extremely addicting to watch. I know myself because I binge watched the series. Amy Pohler did a terrific job starring and producing in the show as well as making people laugh. Nick Offerman personally my favorite character on the show had over 50 different quotes that made me laugh. Christ Pratt and Aubrey Plaza made a hilarious and terrific couple on the show which also took them to further stardom for the actors. Rashida Jones Leslie's beast friend in the shows had the perfect reactions. Aziz Ansari another one of my favorite characters on the show had a fun amount of swagger and was enjoyable to watch him. Rob Lowe also did a perfect job at being a crazy healthy boss to the characters as well as being Bens friend. And for Jerry he was obviously always being made fun of and hilarious to watch. Parks and recreations final episode was a touching tribute to the shows previous episodes and personally my favorite episode. All in all Parks and Recreation is a hilarious and touching show with a great cast and shall be treasured for years to come.,Parks and Recreation,10
"If you haven't seen parks and rec, you really need to","Parks and Recreation is am extremely funny and emotional journey through 7 seasons.,through out this show we you get to know the characters and they start to grow on you and with every passing episode you love them more and more and thats something that a lot of shows forget about is that for a show to be good the characters need to be sold in there world and not go over same plot lines over and over again, i was very upset that the 7th season was there final but it the finally was very true to the show and how it's progressed.,all in all one of the best shows i've ever seen and easily my favourite TV show of all time",Parks and Recreation,10
I hate every character.,"The whole show is about nothing, not in a Seinfeld way, and when it's not it either doesn't do anything with it or tries to over use the plot setup making it seem amateur and sloppily written, in other words, boring. I have yet to see a witty twist, or an episode the whole plot isn't revealed within 2 minutes. Even while watching it gives me zero interest in the characters and this is why....,None of the characters are very likable, besides Mr Offerman, and he is barely in the show except for one rant about how the gov sucks per episode or how manly he is. Rashida and Aubrey are characters I hate in real life, except when I see them in interviews I realize they actually are people I just want to punch in the face. Amy isn't annoying to me, but she can't make me laugh because her acting is so forced, or is it just that poorly written... Aziz is just totally out of place, like a comic that has to do a set but always has to go after the least funny person ever. I often feel Aziz does improv because he goes from ""trying"" to be funny to having the Aziz Anasari charm.,Overall the chemistry of the characters is about zero. The acting is mediocre at best. I think they got them together just like how Top Gear US did. I used to DVR this for backup when I am bored and nothing is on, but after season 2 I gave up altogether finding I'd rather watch reruns of other shows before I wanted to watch Parks and Recreation.",Parks and Recreation,5
"Likable, but not lovable","I've watched a fair share of episodes of Parks and Recreation, hoping that it would grow on me. While it has some golden moments, the show as a whole consistently fails to get any real reaction out of me-- no big laughs, no tears, no knuckle-biting suspense. The early seasons of the Office (the big brother show of Parks & Rec) managed to give me all of these at one point or another, even though it too took place in a seemingly boring setting. So where does this show go wrong?,I think the problem is that they're not willing to take things far enough. Some of the characters (Tom and Ron Swanson, for example) are reliably funny and have the potential to be truly outrageous, but they always seem to stop short for fear of seeming too dark or unlikable. Others are boring and have no depth to them, like Ann, who might as well carry a sign around that says, ""I'm the sane, charming, pretty one who you're supposed to root for!"" And others are downright obnoxious, like Andy, an even more cartoonish loser than Seth Rogen's character in Knocked Up.,We all know Parks and Recreation was created in the wake of the Office, which is OK. But it should be taking steps forward from there, not backward into lukewarm sitcom territory. I hope that in the future, they give their characters a little more pathos and put more thought into their story lines. Too much to ask?",Parks and Recreation,
Heaton hits a home run,"Often times an actor or actress gets associated with an iconic role, a role they basically continue to play over and over, no matter what show or movie they're in. Happily, this is not the case for Patricia Heaton in her new show ""The Middle"". Her new character, while still a wife and mother of three, is much different than Debra Barone, the character she played for 9 years in ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" ,In Debra, Heaton developed a character identified by her sharp, sarcastic wit, razor-sharp tongue, explosive temper, sexy appearance and a love-hate relationship with her husband and his family. Debra's problems were dealing with her passive-aggressive mother-in-law and her over-the-top intrusiveness, or the little ""moral superiority"" battles with Raymond. Because of this limited source for trouble and tension, the problems they had, while funny,were not down-to-earth, day-to-day problems most average families worry about.,In Frankie, Heaton has created a character who is more of a mother than a wife, and is on the same level as her husband instead of above him. That makes a huge difference in the tone of the show, and it's quite refreshing. The problems this family faces are problems most families can identify with, from struggling with bills and worrying about work to having a kid who just can't seem to get it together and find his or her place in the world. Frankie doesn't have time to worry about who didn't put up a suitcase or to fake a boob job to prove some minor point; she has to work together with her whole family just to get by. They face each crisis together, and sometimes have to settle for a less than optimal solution. But at the end of the day, they love and support each other in sweet, often surprisingly tender ways.,While not laugh out loud funny, the show has a sweetness and reality to it I find enjoyable. It has the same feel as old classic sitcoms from the 70's and early 80's, an era many consider to be the Golden Age of sitcom television. I think the biggest draw for me, though, is that I LIKE this family; I'd like to live next door to them, and get to know them. And really, can you say anything better about a show than that, that it makes a family so real and so genuine that you'd be happy to have them as neighbors? I hope the show continues and only gets better.",The Middle,9
"""Park & Recreations"" Aren't Funny.","I really wanted to like this show, but after watching the first 3 episodes (and one episode with the wife who didn't care for it), it's safe to say that this show is not ""The Office"". It really seems like it's trying to be similar to it, but it's just not funny. It's not Amy Poehler's fault. The scripts are just poorly written. It doesn't help that her surrounding cast aren't the greatest comedians in the business either. Besides Aziz Ansari (Tom) character, most of the other members just aren't that funny. Where as ""The Office"" scripts are written well for each character/actor on that show, what's written for the casts of P&R seems like force entertainment. You can see Amy is struggling as she deliver her lines and then thinking to herself, (this doesn't sound all that funny). Watch the show and the expressions on her face and you'll see what I mean. It's like they need to fire their writers and hire Tina Fey. Not sure what Rashida Jones was thinking. She should have stayed on ""The Office"". She does make cameo appearance from time to time on that show, but I honestly don't expect P&R to be around much longer unless they get new writers. The Pilot wasn't bad, but it seems like it's going downhill every episode. The last episode with Leslie on a date she wasn't aware of was terrible. Ann getting angry about Andy cast being on longer then it needed to be, did make the episode any more enjoyable. I haven't see anymore episodes on T.V. Either the show has already been canceled or it's on hiatus for the summer. I'll give it another shot if it returns, but if it still isn't great, I'll unschedule it from my DVR.",Parks and Recreation,5
Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I am a big Amy Poehler and Tina Fey fan. I absolutely love '30 Rock' and when I heard that Amy Poehler was also going to be starring in her own show, I was psyched.,'Parks and Recreation' is definitely a show similar in style to 'Arrested Development,' 'The Office,' and '30 Rock,' so if you like any of those shows, I would definitely recommend it. Yes, I agree with some of the other comments that described the pilot as a little slow, but all shows take a bit to get into.,I absolutely adore dead pan comedy shows with no laugh track and I highly recommend this show. Amy Poehler's work is great and I support her 100%!!",Parks and Recreation,10
Retread,"A shameless regurgitation of almost all of the comedic mechanics executed in The Office....so much so that I simply couldn't look beyond it. This alone cast a pallor upon the show...it felt contaminated....not from a principled perspective...but from more of a ""been there, done that"" perspective which made the humor seem flaccid...without flavor.,The bottom line is, I wasn't laughing. A few smiles here and there but...that's about it.,I won't be watching any more episodes, sad to say. I simply don't have the time to give for this show to try to redeem itself...which seems impossible from the onset.",Parks and Recreation,5
Best new show of the season,"I had no particular hopes for this show. Of all the sitcoms on ABC's new ""Wednesday Comedy Night"" this is the one I expected to like the least, so it came as quite a surprise how funny and entertaining the pilot episode was. It moves along nicely and the cast is excellent. I always thought Heaton was talented but could never really enjoy her on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND because her character was, quite frankly, an unendurable bitch. Here she has a chance to project a little more warmth and likability and really shines. The real charmer in the cast is Eden Sher as the teenage daughter, a marvel of gawky authenticity. I fear THE MIDDLE may be just a shade too subtle for audiences who tastes run to fart joke and similar crudity, but more discriminating viewers should definitely check it out.",The Middle,10
"Finally, a show I can watch with my family.","I'm guessing the family portrayed in 'The Middle' is not the norm but they certainly are closer to 'real' people than most sitcom characters or, for that matter, most 'reality' show contestants. The children are not perfect nor are they drug addicted or sex-crazed or alcoholic or parent-hating brats. The oldest son hanging out in boxer shorts? My son did that. The middle child, the daughter, trying to find her place in the school social order but often coming up short? Who hasn't failed at something in life? And the youngest child, the little boy who often repeats things in a whisper, is sweet and loves his parents. These kids make you laugh both from their unintentional humor and from recognition. And I especially like the fact that each episode ends on an upbeat note. The family members, no matter what crazy circumstances they may find themselves in, love each other and accept their lot in life without bitterness and anger. Far removed from the pop culture norms we've been fed lately, people living in 'The Middle' may actually exist after all.",The Middle,8
"Very underrated, innocent family comedy","I really wish ABC would promote this show more, and give the actors credit for their work. They have been robbed of Emmy nominations twice. I honestly enjoy Modern Family but I don't get why that show gets a million Emmy nods every year. Anyway, I've been watching since day 1 and have loved it since. Frankie Heck is the harried car-saleslady mother of 3 kids, living in the fictional town of Orson, Indiana. She is always trying to get the kids to bond, while trying to get by herself, as she and her husband Mike don't make a lot of money and their house is always a mess. Axl, the oldest, is a typical lazy, sarcastic teenager who is almost always making fun of his sister Sue, the middle teen daughter. She is very optimistic and bubbly, but nobody really knows she exists, and can never make anything out of herself, especially at school. Finally we have little Brick, who's nose is always stuck in a book and doesn't really have any friends, but if he does make a friend, they're even quirkier than he is. And they are always trying to compete with their practically perfect neighbors, the Donahues. I think we can all relate to this show in some way--the house is always a mess, the mom doesn't always feel like cooking so she brings home fast food, there's those neighbors who are like the perfect family that you've always wanted to be, and the kids don't always get along. It's not laugh out loud funny but I still tune in every Wednesday. And it is NOT a ripoff of Malcolm. That show was about 4 brothers, one of them being a genius. And they lived in California whereas the Hecks live in the MID-west. And they're middle-income, and this show is focused on the mom, trying to do her best to support her family. This show also has more positive vibes. If it didn't have the word ""Middle"" in the title, people probably wouldn't say a word, right? 8/10.",The Middle,10
Parks and Recreation reigns supreme in the sitcom comedy genre!,"While Parks and Recreation may not have the awards and ratings of its predecessors, it still manages to provide absolutely hysterical comedy that just brings out that good feeling. Parks and Rec's greatest strength has to be its superb cast. Unlike The Office, most supporting cast members are developed enough to become the main subject for any given episode. The supporting cast, at times, even triumphs over the main cast. While the main cast of Parks and Rec might be smaller, these characters still Pack-A-Punch. Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman's great deliveries provide a countless number of quotable, classic lines. The stories of each Parks and Rec episode tend focus on very interesting plots that help keep the show fresh and consistently funny. Overall Parks and Recreation is by far the BEST television show I have watched in history, and I look forward to the show ending with a bang in its 7th and final season!!!",Parks and Recreation,10
"Wonderfully original, entertaining, and satisfying new comedy!","Supernaturally talented Patricia Heaton may be doomed to playing the long suffering wife now, as far as television goes -- but she is SO good at it. After who knows how many seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond she appears to have completely mastered the role. And who's complaining? I would never have thought there was so much fertile ground left for family comedy but the writers seem to have tapped a whole new vein. Patricia Heaton being one of the most talented humans ever, your expectations are high on anything new from this lady. No disappointments here! Great story - great imagery - sizzling dialog - wonderful character work from a top-notch cast. Where are all these brilliant new kid actors coming from? Atticus Shaffer is simply miraculous in his role as the ... ""unusual child"". There was so much entertaining content in this half-hour (or about 22 minutes, I guess, minus the commercials) that I felt like I'd watched a class A feature film comedy. It's not going to be easy to maintain this level of excellence but if they even get close, I'll be a huge fan. Can't wait to see the next episode!",The Middle,
Real and Funny,"You'd want to see this show because of the household names, Patricia Heaton, Neil Flynn, Chris Kattan, Brian Doyle Murray, and you'd be pleasantly surprised by the writing. We all ""know"" the harried mom, laid back dad, ""under achiever"" kids, but within a twenty minute episode I realize how really well the writers capture the frustration and absurdity that goes with life in ""the middle"". This program doesn't fit the ""oh poor hapless daddy"" sitcoms, the kind Bob Newhart would NEVER do, and that's why I've been watching it. Because they have a real mess of a home and wear clothes you do see in the newspaper insert ads, these are some real people dealing with some way out there kinds of characters in situations which are hilarious and sometimes heartwarming, without being mushy. This is one show I look forward to each week!!",The Middle,9
Really enjoyable comedy,"There's a number of shows that I record every week and this is one of them. Whenever I go to catch up on watching shows that were recorded, there are some that are starting to feel like a chore to watch, but I always looks forward to watching this one.,I was never a fan of ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" so I never saw too much of Patricia Heaton, but she's really very good in this show. I think most of the characters in this show are really well cast. I think Eden Sher as the daughter ""Sue"" is terrific. She's such a lovable nerd. Neil Flynn who plays the husband ""Mike"" is funny and believable. Atticus Shaffer as the youngest son ""Brick"" is pretty bizarre, but somehow I find myself laughing at him, especially when he repeats to himself in a whisper, the last word of his sentences. I can't explain why, but it's funny to me every time he does it.,I hope the show doesn't get old for me. I've watched the first 9 episodes so far and haven't been disappointed yet.",The Middle,9
A Home Run,"Thank you, ABC, for putting a great group of comedy writers together to support this all star cast. Barbara Heaton as the used car saleslady mom and the janitor from Scrubs as the dad are the best parents I've seen on t.v. in a long time. The 3 children are given meaty characterizations to play and I hope they will win many awards. The kids and the other supporting cast (including Chris Kattan and the car lot boss) couldn't have been cast better. Every show gives me old fashioned belly laughs and inspiration that, like this family struggling to survive in the middle class (the reason for its name, not named for the middle of the country in which it takes place) we can all learn a lesson in what makes families strong.",The Middle,10
Patricia Heaton rises up as the star of her own show!,"Emmy winner Patricia Heaton plays a mom, Frances, better known as Frankie in the Middle of the country in Indiana. She has three children with her husband. They both work jobs. She's a car salesman and he works in an office. They have a daughter who tries to achieve or win but always loses. An awkward youngest son who she uses an actual sale to pick him up from school because she or her husband forgot to pick him up. Her oldest son, Axel, doesn't wear his shirt around the house and only comes down to eat. I could relate to this story. I think her role of Frankie is far more interesting than her other roles. Her home is not in order physically and the family lives in the middle of the country. The show starts off with Frankie wearing a superwoman costume because her youngest son, Brick, has said that his mom is his hero. It's not a bad show but you should all watch it if you have families or live outside Hollywood as most of us do. I like seeing her back on the air. She is the star and expect to see her name next year for an Emmy. She's got another shot at it. This show is funny, witty, and off-beat enough for Emmy voters.",The Middle,

jimmy eat this show,just got done watching ''the middle'and in all seriousness. i thought it was great a funny show from a mothers point of view. think ''Malcolm in the Middle'' but instead of his point of view the moms. i thought the kids were funny the daughter especially. me personally i thought this show works on many levels and would be surprised if it doesn't get picked up for a second season.i mean there is always crappy shows that get picked up. this one this one has potential with patricia heaton as the lead role is great. personally i thought raymond was a terrible show but she was good and is more realistic in this role. whats that we have more the janitor of one of my all time favorite shows scrubs. yes the funny witty hilarious janitor from scrubs plays the role of the father in this show. he's likable as the dad who doesn't really care about much but means well. so all and all i liked in 9/10.,The Middle,
Awful!!,"First of all, this show is so exaggerated, bad acting, and lack of originality. I really tried to like this show, watching enough episodes, but i see this so exaggerated. Also, this show is a bad copy of a very funny show ""Malcolm in the Middle"". Malcolm is far more funny and original. This show is a copy for many reasons. First, the name. Other is that the main character relate the episode. Another thing is the characters. Brick looks like Dewey. Mike is also similar as Hal.The setting is the same as in Malcolm. Also the families are in the same social class and have the same economic problems. In this show, the characters are weak and boring. Also the character of Sue is so exaggerated and foolish. This show will never be as funny as Malcolm in the Middle. So, if you've already seen Malcolm, i don't think you'll like this show.",The Middle,1
"This show shucks nuts, yes ""shucks"" them","This show is horribly boring, I've attempted to watch it on several occasions each time worse than the previous. The show, while well cast, is poorly written in that it fails to do the sole thing the show is made for- to produce laughs. It tries too hard to be funny and it's just not, in fact, it's hard to tell when you're supposed to laugh because there's just nothing in the show that is clever or funny. The episodes are short yet they seem to drag on as the characters just sort of f**k around. The characters are fairly annoying and dumb which should make for an interesting show, it works in ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" So shouldn't it work for this show? Well no, it doesn't, at all, sense is a word that seems to have escaped their vocabulary. Some shows can be clever and dumb at the same time and they are hilarious, this is not one of those shows.

"Good fun, good laugh and an incredibly good programme!","Even though I'm 13, I love The Middle, even though I don't think I'm apart of the target audience. It makes me laugh very much and it's the same story with my younger sisters. We have many episodes recorded at home! The plot lines are very real and very funny and amusing. The characters are also very realistic. I also love how it isn't always comedy and that there's a little bit of other genres too, but still it's mostly comedy. I love watching The Middle as its, entertaining, hilarious, fun and gets me in a happy mood. Sometimes I can also relate to the story plots such as the house looking a complete mess and wanting all the new trends! I also like how Patricia Heaton, who plays Frankie Heck, narrates during parts of the show. It's something different and I like it! They are the many reasons why I love to watch The Middle! Overall I cannot put anything else in the review except for I love it!",The Middle,10
terrible terrible show,"This TV show seems to be dead set on taking the previous crown that Malcolm in the middle had rightly earnt. The problem with this show is the characters are very weak and in no way have any of the charisma the characters from Malcome in the middle commanded.If anything this show makes you miss the original Malcolm in the Middle show more. Yes you will smile yes very occasionally you will laugh but the show just doesn't seem to hit the spot and my wife pretty much hit the nail on the head when she walked in the room and said ""is it trying to be Malcolm in the middle ? because if it is it isn't doing a good job"" Its not often i will sit down and comment/review a TV show but i feel so let down by this show i just had to voice my opinion on it. I really have tried to like this TV program but i have now just ran out of patience with it.",The Middle,1
Pleasantly Surprised,"The only reason I tuned into this show was for Neil Flynn. I was a huge fan of his character as Janitor on Scrubs. I had little hopes because I was not a huge Patricia Heaton fan. I have found now that was not her fault, but the fault of the writers of Everybody Loves Raymond. They made her such a hard to like character that you could not help but dislike her. I mean who would have stayed married to her? Anyway, I digress, The Middle is rather charming. I find myself constantly rolling my eyes (in a good way) at Axl, cheering for Sue and trying to guess what Brick will do next. The Middle is a great example of the average American family trying to stay afloat in today's economy. They portray the way most of us in my age demographic grew up in the Midwest. I am astounded as someone who spent Jr. High and High School in Iowa at just how accurate they are. I will be around watching for as long as they keep the show on the air.",The Middle,10
how can anyone with a brain like this?,"this show is so awful. I can't even watch it. I mean where is the humor? it's just awful the jokes. the family with their pithy dialogue. is rubbish. what was ABC thinking of having this on their station? I mean, the writers can't even write. did they think ""oh gee. I should really make this TV show. for others to watch it"" give me a break. I can write a way better sitcom,TV show than this and I'm not even a writer. ABC. please cancel this awful show. I don't know how this is on the air. I've tried and tried to watch it and every time. I'm like ""I feel like I am lowering my IQ watching this"" I knew this sitcom would be awful since, Rosanne created it. this is the worst The series features Frances ""Frankie"" Heck (Patricia Heaton), a working class, middle-aged, Midwestern [2] woman and her husband Mike (Neil Flynn), who reside in the small fictional town of Orson in Southwest Indiana. They are the parents of three children, Axl (Charlie McDermott), Sue (Eden Sher), and Brick (Atticus Shaffer).[3] The series is narrated by Frankie, initially an under-performing salesperson at a used-car dealership and later a dental assistant. Her stoic husband Mike manages a local quarry and serves as a stabilizing influence in the family. The children are quite different from one another: oldest son Axl, a popular but under-motivated and cynical teenager, does well in sports but not in academics; daughter Sue is an enthusiastic young teen but chronically unsuccessful and socially awkward; and youngest son Brick, an intelligent but introverted compulsive reader with quirky behavioral traits.",The Middle,1
Finally!! A good family show!!,"I am so pleased that there is finally a good family show on the air that doesn't promote social/political stances and shove their viewpoint in everyone's face! Patricia Heaton is back and with a vengeance! I have been a fan of Ms. Heaton's every since her days on Thirty Something and Everybody Loves Raymond. Her comedic timing is dead on and her facial expressions suit the moment perfectly; not to mention that her acting skills are per near flawless. When you watch this show, you can really feel what the family is going through and that is, at least in part, due to Patricia Heaton's performance.,Eden Shur as Sue Heck is brilliant! I was the Sue Heck of my school and remember vividly trying out for everything and always failing yet I always stayed optimistic that eventually, something would turn out :) My parents were always supportive of me as well although I'm sure my school years debacles were a source of humor for them as Sue's are for her parents. Charlie McDermott is hilarious as Axel..oh my gosh! He reminds me of my high school boyfriend. Neil Flynn and Atticus Shaffer are wonderful as well.,I enjoy this show completely and hope it stays on the air for a long time!!",The Middle,10
Hi-lar-i-ous,"This show is so awesome and totally rocks. This isn't you're over-hyped new sitcom, this blows all of those type of shows out of the water. Their is no lame actors like David Spade or Seth Green on this show, those guys just bounce around from one bad sitcom to the next without any actual skill while doing so.,The story is about a lower middle class family from Indiana. Patricia Heaton is the lead of the show as the mom, Neil Flynn from Scrubs fame as the dad. The kids on he show are Axl who's the oldest who's a lazy jock, Sue is the overambitious daughter with no real skills but that doesn't stop her and Brick is the bookworm youngest who says the same thing to himself twice.",The Middle,10
One Heck of a show; definitely not your average comedy.,"The best thing about this new series is that it doesn't take itself at all seriously. There are no hidden agendas and there's very little sentimentality; which is quite refreshing to see in an American sit-com as all too often the viewer is comforted with the nicer side of life! Patricia Heaton (Frankie Heck) may be reprising the role of an unappreciated wife, but this time she's different, she's let off the leash and has real bite. She also narrates the show which is a kinda cool. Frankie's husband is Mike Heck (Neil Flynn) a Quarry Manager that's a little too laid-back for Frankie liking, but the pair gel very well and they do seem to still love each other after having three kids. The eldest is Axl, a typical teenager who wants to be a rock star or playboy to the stars. Of course he's completely deluded and isn't exactly a grade-A student, but what he does have going for him is his sporting prowess. He appears to be in all the sports teams. He's also very loyal to his family, but it's very subtle; you have to watch to see what I mean. Sue Heck is the nearest thing to Meg Griffin in real TV. Continually in a state neurotic insecurity and anonymity; Sue repeatedly fails to make any impact regarding after school activities – she literally tries-out for everything! Yet, she struggles on with incredible tenacity, a quality that's quite inspiring to see. Unlike Meg, Sue is pretty, slim and glasses free; but at 14, she still wears braces. Everyone (including her tutors) can never seem to remember her name or face, this only exacerbates her self-consciousness and anxiety. Look out for how delighted she is to make the school cross-country team (albeit contrived). The final component of the Heck family is Brick, a 9 year old loner with a reading fixation. Brick doesn't suffer fools lightly, he's very selective about to whom he speaks and he comes across as an evil genius in the making. Brick is very forgetful and shows little interest in anything other than his books. Nevertheless he's an interesting character and not cutesy which is always good! For me though Sue (Eden Sher) is the real gem in this new sit-com; she's very amusing, stupid and naive, yet her never say die attitude is heart-warming and a delight to see. I hope The Middle goes for a few more seasons, just to see how Sue gets on!",The Middle,7
"Malcome in the Middle, without the Malcome... or the class.","You have to be kidding me with this series? The only joke is the series it's self, where is the class where is the character and what is it with these TV shows now days where the narrator has to spoon feed you the episode.,Brick will never ever be a Dewey. I dunno, I kinda feel sorry for Patricia Heaton. She was fantastic in Everybody loves Raymond and in my opinion, she was even better in Back to You.,In general I don't find the American humor that great, it all feels dumbed down and pre-canned.,Ugh.",The Middle,1
"Unoriginal and bland, but expected","After watching the Pilot episode I felt like I had already had enough; traces of 'Malcolm in the Middle' are all too evident here and each role in this show attempts to fill the boots of those that feature in the far more successful show, 'Malcolm in the Middle'. None more so than the mother and the father whom both have similar personality traits to that of 'Lois' and 'Hal'. The youngest son, Brick, mirrors 'Dewey' in almost every single way and I feel utterly insulted that I was expected to not recognise the clear hints of plagiarism between the casts that are thrown in your face at every opportunity the writers get to squeeze in another recycled joke.,This show is narrated by the mother, which is similar to how Malcolm narrates 'Malcolm in the Middle'. However, unfortunately, the narration is too miscalibrated with the character of the mother. It would seem as if they were two different characters.,So, if you have watched Malcolm in the Middle in addition to being able to tell your rear end and elbow apart with success, you will more or less be able to tell what the characters are saying with the television on mute (which seems somewhat preferable now). Overall, a very unrefreshing addition to the somewhat dismal arsenal that Sky TV already offer. Did I expect anything else?",The Middle,2
Just Bad,"The Middle seems like a not as funny version of Modern Family or other ""dysfunctional family shows"". ,Within the first five minutes of the show's premiere, I came to a conclusion...it is a clear ripoff of Malcolm in the Middle. The mothers are almost exactly the same! Brick is exactly like Dewey! The setting is the same and the families are in the same situation in terms of money and class. ,The jokes in The Middle are dumbed down as if the show was made for 3rd graders to understand. Maybe if you have never seen Malcolm in the Middle, or if you're just uneducated or have something wrong with you, then you might enjoy this show. I honestly couldn't sit through the first four episodes. I'm just sick of this show right now.",The Middle,1
The best family comedy,"I'm sorry I have to disagree with previous reviewers who do not like this show. I was an absolute devotee of Everybody Loves Raymond and Patricia Heaton deserved her awards in those days, but this to me is a far better show because the message in the end is usually positive and family-affirming. Yes I was at first put off by the crazy kids too but watch for a while and you'll see they have incredible talent, as does the whole family. Every cast member is a real character, but Frankie Heck steals the show every time. It really is a matter of taste and I hope the producers realise this appeals a LOT to middle class families. All the situations the Hecks get into are SO real, and Patricia Heaton is absolutely at her best, completely believable and hilarious.Brilliant, brilliant brilliant.Love it to bits. Laugh out loud stuff. Renew this programme!",The Middle,10
Exaggerating the Un-funny,"Contains Spoilers from the Pilot episode.,Although the name would suggest otherwise, ABC's ""The Middle"" is at the bottom of the list of great new television shows. Patricia Heaton (""Everybody Loves Raymond"") stars as a frustrated mom of three run-of-the-mill TV stereotypes (the angsty teenager, the weirdo, and the cute little kid that nobody likes), trying to balance what almost all moms have to deal with. Although it is easy to relate to her, it is extremely boring to watch (there's a reason that we don't all get our own television shows...) The Pilot episode focused around the troubles of forgetting to pick up your kid at school, scheduling two things at once, money problems, job troubles, family disagreements, and other ""relatable"", yet entirely ordinary, scenarios. ,The true reason I wanted to watch this show was because of Neil Flynn (""Scrubs"") and Chris Kattan (""Saturday Night Live""), however their characters are not developed enough to make me want to endure the terrible story line. ,If you feel like watching something, avoid ""The Middle"" and instead watch ABC's other new show, ""Modern Family"", which will hopefully absorb all the Wednesday night attention so ""The Middle"" can die with a little dignity.",The Middle,1
A good honest well acted comedy that is also funny!,"A late (2nd season) quick review.,This is a very good family sitcom based on the actual life of its writer when he was a teenager. The presentation of the show is using the narration of an older version of himself with emphasis in the specific characteristics of the 80s that leaves a nostalgic feeling for the era.,No fake laughs (live or prerecorded) here.,Exceptional casting. True to life situations. Funny in a good way (without being ridiculous or vulgar like other comedies out there). Honest to the heart.,In a sentence: Watch it and you wont be disappointed!",The Goldbergs,
About time!,"Its about time we get a great show like this! It reminds me so much of The Wonder Years (One of my favourite shows of all times). It is funny, all the actors are fantastic and have great chemistry together. After 3 episodes it quickly became my new favourite show. At the end of each episode there is a clip of the real family it is based on (Adam Goldberg) which I love. I think this is why the show works so great, is because its based on a real family and real stories. So many shows and movies you watch and there isn't anything realistic about it, so they are entertaining but not something you can relate to. That is not the case with this show, and that is why it reminds me so much of The Wonder Years. It mixes comedy with story telling. I can't rave about this show enough, and I will be FURIOUS if it gets cancelled.",The Goldbergs,10
Don't listen to the haters,"It is quite unusual for me to laugh very hard, when I am watching an episode of a show. But with The Goldbergs I was cracking up by the first half of the first episode, I could not resist to write my first review on IMDb.,You should ignore some early wannabe critics for hating something about this show. It is brilliantly cast, played and written. The timing of the jokes is spot on. After a few minutes you need to pause the episode to get yourself together again.,If you need some references for the style of the show: It's a brilliant mix of Curb your Enthusiasm's angryness and The Wonder Year's nostalgia.,Pleas watch the first episode to see it for yourself. The Goldbergs could be the next big thing in comedy.",The Goldbergs,10
"One of the best, funniest and most refreshing shows currently on television","Dennis (Glenn Howerton), Mac (Rob McElhenney), and Charlie (Charlie Day) are all the owners of an Irish bar in Philadelphia, and ""Sunny"" essentially follows their awkward lives - each episode revolving around some type of political or social issue such as gun control, abortion, steroids, underage drinking, health care, and the handicapped (just to touch on a few issues already addressed in the show).,It begs comparison with ""Arrested Development,"" ""The Office,"" ""Seinfeld"" and ""South Park"" in its broad humor and wit, but it is completely original in its own right. The pilot was filmed on a low budget by a few friends and was picked up by FX after wards, so the show retains its low-budget feel - giving it a gritty, down-to-earth edge.,""Sunny"" does border on the edge of bad taste sometimes (hell, what am I saying - it crosses the line every time) but it contains enough satire and wit to get away with it. For example: in one episode Mac and Dennis decide to pick up girls at an abortion rally. Mac pretends to be pro-life just so he can be around an attractive woman, whom he ends up sleeping with. Later, she tells him she's pregnant. ""You need to get an abortion,"" he says. This type of irony runs throughout every episode.,The banter between the characters in the show is what tends to be particularly funny. The actors - although novices - are all great. Charlie Day in particular has me laughing like crazy every episode. And his interaction with Danny DeVito (who's been brought in for season two) is hilarious. Season two is more polished so far in terms of the mechanics of the show - the characters have all been setup now and they know what they're doing - and in that regard it is seeming to get better and better with every episode.,You do have to have a very sick sense of humor to like some of this - DeVito's character, Frank, is the father of Dennis and Dee, and his reason for being in the show is that he is getting a divorce and wants to relive his glory days as a youth. He tries to re-ignite a relationship with an old girlfriend of his from high school - but when he finds out she's a grandmother and not interested in doing anything wild, his attention instantly turns to the waitress and he tunes her out. It's cruel, sick and hilarious. DeVito is playing another ruthless character (same as in ""Taxi"" all those years ago) and it works splendidly.,Overall this was a delightful blast of fresh air - after seeing so many stale sitcoms, this proved to me that FX really is becoming the new lead in character-driven comedy-dramas (such as the equally superb ""Rescue Me"" which isn't quite as funny, however).,My only hope is that ""Sunny"" doesn't become so popular that it attracts controversy and sells out and dumbs down its humor. Right now it's on par with the early episodes of ""South Park"" and ""SNL"" in terms of how irreverent its humor is - and personally, in my opinion, its plots are better than most comedy films I've seen within the last few years.,If you want to see something new, different, and funny, check this out. I have a feeling it could either become huge, like the next ""Seinfeld,"" or - more realistically - it will become a cult phenomenon. Either way, I'll be watching.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Children of the 80's UNITE!!,"I have to admit, that when I watched the first episode of this show, it reminded me so much of The Wonder Years that it was distracting. That being said, after episode 2 and 3, I hardly notice the narration. I think the first episode had a ton more narration because of character introductions and such, but 2 and 3 have gotten progressively funnier, and all of the 80's nostalgia is very endearing to me. ,I grew up in the 80's, and this show hit's the nail on the head! The characters are believable and relate-able, the writing is very cohesive and well thought out, and the acting is very convincing and hilarious. I found myself laughing out loud over and over again.,Don't listen to all the haters. Give this show a shot and you won't be disappointed.",The Goldbergs,9
Heartwarming & Charming,"I believe it depends on what type family you grew up with whether you enjoy this program or not; and although my family was not exactly like this, nor did we grow up in the 80s, The Goldbergs is quite charming and each episode has struck a nerve with this viewer and tugged at my heartstrings.,The fact that Adam F. Goldberg is culling story lines from actual family life experiences gives this series a sense of realism other shows lack. Further, it is driven by sincerity, rather than dependent on trying too hard for a quota of laughs.,The Goldbergs is a winner, which I highly recommend.,A word for The Goldbergs bashers: It's OK, to turn off the intellect and take an emotional ride and enjoy life, rather than looking for flaws in an effort to project your superiority.",The Goldbergs,8
Stumbled Onto a Good New Show,"I haven't seen a single commercial for this show, but I recognized the mom from Reno 911 and figured I would give it a shot. It's actually pretty good. Having grown up in suburban Philly in the 80's, they have pretty much nailed a typical Northeast Philly suburb. The writing is good, and the plot is fun to follow. I think you will really enjoy this show if you like smart, funny comedies you can relate to. The clothes are dead on for 1985. The house is exactly like every house I ever went into in our neighborhood, and just as tacky. The family dynamic is very familiar, and accurately represents a typical Philly family. I urge you to give this show a chance. You will more than likely see a lot of your own family in these characters.",The Goldbergs,9
The best 'dark comedy' on TV,"This is a genuinely funny show, well worth watching, and deserving of it's high ratings on this site. It's compared to South Park for a number of reasons, most notably the enthusiasm with which it tackles socially sensitive issues and assaults them with the most extremist brands of political incorrectness --- but whereas South Park always tries to tidy up it's mess and make sure the audience knows the distinction between right and wrong, this show revels in the depravity and insanity of it's sociopathy. And it works amazingly well.,Since it's a situational comedy, there's not much to say about it without giving away the goods, but the actors all work better than any cast I've seen in a long time. It really seems like half the show is improvised and that the cast is talented enough to make it work without a hitch. The first few episodes are definitely the weakest, but still stronger than just about any comedy out there.,Highly recommended.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,9
My new favorite show,"Now that Arrested Development has been laid to rest (RIP), I have found the next best thing.,""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" is different and funny, in a crossing-moral-lines kind of way. Good for FX that they have the cojones to put this show on.,How can you not laugh when story lines involve trying to take financial advantage of a religious miracle, or considering sleeping with your fiend's mom to get even, or tea-bagging (not the actual act, but, 'nuff said)?,I can only hope this show stays on the air long enough to gain sufficient viewers to not get canceled.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Which Character Where You In the 80s?,"This was written at almost the end of the first season. I can't speak for more than that. But so far, It's really, really funny.,If you did not experience the 80s, you may not 'get it.' But if you are old enough to remember the 80s at all, this show is hysterical. It's pretty funny anyway, but being a part of that decade and remembering everything that this show has gotten so RIGHT makes it extra special. ,It's not 100% dead-on as far as a perfectly written, directed or acted show goes, but there are so many moments during every episode that I laugh out loud, due to something the perfect cast does to bring back such great memories. There are some things that will vary from this family and yours. If you want it to mimic your family, go make your own show. But this family is FUNNY. It's obviously a very 'Jewish' type family, and my family is not. That is the only part I can't relate with. But everything from the clothes, the games, the toys, the furniture, the chords on the big phones, the electronic gadgets we though were 'sooo coool,' the cars and the movie references - - and so many other things -- are all so endearing. The way they twist these things into a funny dialogue is great.,You can't help but try and remember yourself or one of your family members doing something very close to what the characters are doing. Every episode I find myself saying, ""I remember when I did that,"" or ""My Dad said that same thing!"" Although my Dad did leave his pants on. Sometimes I'm remembering myself as the little kid, other times I'm the older brother. What good times.,I sincerely hope this show sticks around because I'll watch them all. If you are a child of the 80s or if you raised children during them, you'll dig this show.",The Goldbergs,9
Pure brilliance,"While I am typically not a fan of television, I can't get enough of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. ,As a resident of Philadelphia and one who enjoys the more scenic and luxurious aspects of life here, 'Sunny' doesn't exactly shine a great light on the city, but it IS without a doubt one of the most brilliant works of ensemble comedy I have ever seen. ,It's irreverent, self-serving characters without a doubt suggest a bit of a naughty Seifeld. Yet dare I say it, it's more than that. The subtle interplay of class politics, ivy-league pomp, and south-philly street smarts go far beyond Seinfeld's tried-and-true model.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
One of the funniest shows on television.,"There hasn't been a show in the world that makes me laugh as hard or as often than It's Always Sunny in its prime. Seasons 1 through 5 have some of the best, sharpest comedy writing in ages. Since then, the show hasn't been as consistently brilliant, but there are gems in every season. The premise is very simple. It's about the life of four Philly bar owners. At least until season 2 brings in the father of siblings Dennis and Dee, Frank Reynolds, played to perfection by Danny DeVito, where it becomes a fearless fivesome of hilarity. The thing is, these aren't your ordinary people. They're delusional, narcissistic, borderline-psychotic idiots. The show has been described as ""Seinfeld on crack"" and that's about as good a descriptor you can get. The gang are always coming up with ridiculous schemes and stupid ideas which consistently result in awkwardness and belly laughs. ,One of the best parts of the show is the characters themselves. They come across as shallow douchebags most of the time, because for the most part, they are, but they each have their own distinct personality that mesh so well with the others. Dennis Reynolds is about as close to an everyman that you can get from the gang, and he's a manipulative, insecure, raving sociopath. His sister Dee is almost as depraved but with more self-loathing and less psychopathy. Their father Frank is a rich businessman who traded that life away for living in the slums as a lascivious alcoholic. Specifically, he shares a bed with Charlie, the illiterate, idiot savant wild card of the group. Dennis' roommate Mac is an oblivious closeted homosexual that favors badassery above all else. To put it lightly, they get themselves into some interesting scenarios. Whether they're all together or broken into various group combinations, you can guarantee laughs are to be had.,The chemistry between the actors really sells the whole thing. Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, and Charlie Day are geniuses. Their writing, their acting, it's all so natural and infectious that you can't help but get immersed into any zany idea they come up with just to see how the gang comes out the other side. Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito are just as much necessary pieces to the cast. The humor ranges from uncomfortable to terribly politically incorrect, and that's the beauty of the show. It takes these ""delicate"" topics and shines a light on them that many people are afraid to address. The first season alone deals with racism, abortion, transsexuals, and child molestation. And no matter the topic, they find a way to make it hard-to-breathe hysterical.,I can boast about this show for days, but the fact is you either enjoy the humor or you don't. There's a lot of yelling and plenty of curse words, and it may be grating for newcomers to dip their toes into something like this, especially if they don't know what they're getting into. But for those who do and appreciate clever unrestrained comedy, treat yourself to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.,Great intro episodes: (#3.9) Sweet Dee Is Dating a Retarded Person - (#2.4) Mac Bangs Dennis' Mom - (#2.3) Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare - (#4.10) Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack - (#4.12) The Gang Gets Extreme: Home Make Over Edition - (#6.3) The Gang Buys a Boat",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
About as close to brilliant as you can get,"There are so few television comedies that generate as much humor with generally unlikable characters, and ""Sunny"" probably tops the list. ""Strangers With Candy"" and ""Absolutely Fabulous"" come closest to capturing the laugh-out loud comedy it generates. Part abstract theatre, part absurdist drama, ""Sunny"" not only skewers every hot-button issue imaginable, but barbecues and presents it as a scrumptuous entree. And the zingers ... ""Which one of you fags is my dad?"" and ""You might as well call it Rape Bar"" are killer. Plus being a Philly boy myself, the opening montage with images of The Linc and 30th Street Station are always good for a smile. With ""Drawn Together"" set for its impending exit, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" is the reigning TV king of comedy.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
I enjoy this show,"I came to this show because of Jeff Garlin from Curb.,And I thought a show like the wonder years but closer to my decade would be awesome.,And I enjoyed it. ,It is not the most hilarious show ever.,I definitely had a few laugh out loud moments. But its not just that. This show is something nice to watch without having violence or disturbing themes like many shows today.,This is one of those shows that can give you a break from shows like the walking dead, which are awesome, but can sometimes do your head in.,The 80's references don't annoy me like they have other viewers because I grew up in the 90s. And that is why I think they have so many, because it is not made just for people who were there.,I think people who grew up in the 80s enjoy this show the least.,But everyone should give it a go.,I am glad I did.",The Goldbergs,8
Freaking LOVE the Goldbergs!!,"My husband and I are ""kids of the 80's"" and we freaking love The Goldbergs!! It's great to see the outfits, hear the music, etc... What a great time that was.

I will admit that we weren't too sure about the show after the first episode, but we decided to keep going and are very happy that we did!! These people hating on the show can easily remedy their problem by CHANGING THE CHANNEL!! I don't get the hateful comments, if you don't like it just say that. You don't have to go postal and just be really nasty. I hope they come back with a 2nd and 3rd season of this show. Adam is my favorite, that kid is too funny! Go Goldbergs!!!",The Goldbergs,10
Actually Funny,"I've been a big fan of FX ever since my wife coerced me into watching an episode of Nip/Tuck. I then got sucked into the various other dramas like Rescue Me, 30 Days, Over There, etc.,I was a bit worried about FX trying to do comedy. I didn't think it would work out at all.,And yet, I was completely wrong. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a fantastic show. It's about three guys and a girl that own an Irish pub in Philly. You might be thinking that you've heard similar plot lines, but this is completely different.,The show is politically incorrect, vulgar and hilarious. The first episode deals with racism which is a pretty lofty subject to start with, but it handles it with ease.,This is by far one of the best comedies on TV. Well worth checking out.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,
Can sociopaths be considered as funny?,"Well TV sociopaths can indeed. In the same fashion as Seinfeld and Arrested development, this show deals with a group of unlikeable misfits while they engage in moronic adventures based in equally moronic impulses. The difference with those spiritual predecessors is that Sunny takes it a step further. As the tagline of the show indicates (""Seinfeld on a crack) the writers of this show not only embrace the selfishness of their characters but takes it a step further by completely severing their social awareness and empathy towards other human beings. The result, needless to say, is not only sometimes disturbing, but utterly hilarious. Here is a small introduction of each one of the characters:,-Dennis Reynolds: A malignant narcissist in its truest form. Dennis believes he is the closest to physical perfection a human can achieve. A reputed ladies man, he is not above using alcohol, lies, emotional abuse and even the implication of danger (if they say no) to get girls in bed with him. He shows great amusement by watching how other people might get hurt by his actions, even if those people are his friends or his sister (who he constantly refers to as a bitch). ,-Mac: Dennis's best friend and roommate, he equally enjoys to be part of the gang's plans even if that means hurting or offending innocent people. He even benefits from Dennis's system to pick up and seduce girls, because Dennis let's Mac hit on them when he gets bored with them. Mac believes himself a skilled martial artist (Even if he has not taken one lesson in his whole life) and enjoys resolving problems with violence or vandalism.,-Charlie: Although equally impulsive and alcoholic as the other's in the gang in many ways, he is the only one who has shown he has some empathy for his fellow human being. He spends his time drinking beer or huffing glue (yes, he huffs glue). Being the most naïve from the group he is easily manipulated by the others, although he has shown he isn't above manipulating them either. He is highly resentful and is prone to violent outbursts.,-Deandra ""Sweet Dee"" Reynolds: Dee is as manipulative ad his brother and has been shown as only motivated by her own agenda. She is heavily picked on by the others on the gang because of their misogynistic views. Although as the other characters of the group, specially his brother, she shows no regard for how other people might be getting affected by her actions. She is highly vindictive and she goes to great lengths to make sure her schemes and her lies are being bought by the people involved.,-Frank Reynolds: An impulsive, violent and eccentric ex-millionaire he is highly delusional and carries a gun all the time. His likes include prostitutes, drugs and ham (Yes, ham). He is highly irrational and is always looking to crazier and more idiotic ways to deal with the possible issues that might arise for the gang.,This show appeals to your inner child in the way that this characters really have the mental development of a child, and you will find hilarious how they will impulsively engage in idiotic plans without showing any preoccupation of how the consequences could be for them, their friends or for the people unfortunate enough to get involved with them. Is a refreshing show because it is one of the first comedies that embraces the darkness of its characters and the comedic possibilities of having a group of alcoholic, impulsive, borderline criminal, but dim witted protagonists. These are highly unlikeable people, and their humor might offend you in one way or another, but mark my words: You will enjoy every minute of it.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Great,"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is one of the greatest shows on TV right now. It is daring and hilarious. It was created by three guys on a budget of less than $200, which I find very admirable because I am and aspiring actor/writer. Its raucous stories that run the gamut from cancer to abortion to Nazis to pedophilia are written by the cast. Their devotion to the show is very evident and I hope we will not lose this great show to politics of Hollywood. Heading into is second season I am excited to see what we are going to tackle this summer. I am ready to be shocked and amazed at the lengths these guys and a girl will go to to get over. And with Danny Devito joining the show we are really seeing how ""sunny"" it is in ""Philadelphia""",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
80's child loving this 80's sitcom,"This show is great. Being a child of the 80's, I enjoy all of the references to the 80's such as roller rinks, Ghostbusters, ugly knitted sweaters, windbreakers, and the like.,But the show has something more to it than 80's flashbacks, the family seems genuine and there are plenty of laughs to be had. And there's heart to it as well. If you watch all the way to the very end, you get to see a real clip from the show's creator's real family videos which are the inspiration for the show. ,This show gives me the warm and fuzzies. And not the kind from wearing one of those ugly 80's sweaters.",The Goldbergs,9
It's Just Not Funny,"I love Jeff Garlin. He was brilliant on Curb. He's the reason I wanted to watch this show. I was born in 1976 so I grew up in the 80's. I am the same age as the show's creator, Adam F. Goldberg, and I grew up in Philadelphia. The 80's references they make feel forced throughout the whole show. ""The only one that gets me is Flavor Flav""??? Oh, I get it...because he was around in the 80's. No one in the 80's ever said that. Ever. It seems that every time the writers throw an 80's reference in there it's them reminding you that the show takes place in the 80's. A great example of how to and how not to write a period show would be ""That 70's Show"" & ""That 80's Show"". ""That 70's Show"" was about a group of friends growing up in the 70's. Rarely did a character ever point out the fact it was the 70's. ""That 80's Show"" constantly pointed out 80's things like cell phones the size of bricks and Pac-Man. The same goes for ""The Goldbergs"". They're constantly bringing up 80's references...like REO Speedwagon, Sam Goody & GoBots...and that's just from the pilot. This is a painful show to watch that feels forced most of the time. 3 episodes in and I haven't cracked a smile yet...and I usually laugh at everything. It's so bad that I can't even fathom how anyone with a sense of humor could laugh at it.",The Goldbergs,1
Worse movie ever!? Not with as many laughs as this film gives me.,"I did not realize that Ludacris was so hard up on money,but apparently like Tyrese Gibson barking on Youtube about being broke, The Fast and Furious Franchise aint paying the brothers enough money so apparently he does need to do this alternative.,Luda plays Max, a tough as nails NYPD dog who teams up with Will Arnett, whose obviously trying to not make Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows his worse movie (He failed cause this movie out shines Turtles 2 100 percent). 
Together in a not so uncanny buddy cop movie (cause they did do it in Turner and Hooch) they go under cover as dog show contestants to find an animal smuggler. ,Realistic, this movie is stupid, that's a given, but what it has going for it is that it knows how stupid it is, and with that knowledge you can't help but to laugh at the dumbness going on. ,There are so many points in the movie that are just so foolish, but you can't help but to smirk. It's like Ludacris is taking the role so seriously that the whole thing is...Ludacris (he does the same pun in the film), and I can't help myself. ,So yeah, Show Dogs is bad, but it's definitely worth seeing. It will make you laugh!",Show Dogs,6
The best show currently on cable TV!,"I have said it before, but one of the joys of summer is watching summer shows , knowing that they aren't being given even the slightest chance of survival. In most cases, these shows are being deservingly dumped in the summer because most of them are terrible. Surprisingly, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"", which premiered earlier this month, is not terrible. Even though it seemed like it might have been, it ended up being one of the better shows to come along so far in the 2000s. The show is about four friends who own a bar in Philadelphia. At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything special. The owning a bar scenario has been done several times before in a variety of other sitcoms including ""Cheers"" and the recently canceled ""Grounded For Life"". However, since the show is more clever and much funnier than the previous sitcoms who have used the device, one can forgive the lack of originality.,What makes ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" better than any other of the sitcoms that are on today is the clever writing. The writing on sitcoms these days is beyond awful. The writing on ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" is great. In fact, if the show doesn't receive an Emmmy nomination for writing, there is no justice in the world. The three episodes that have aired so far have been incredibly well written and unlike with most sitcoms, the dialogue doesn't seem like typical sitcom dialogue. The dialogue comes across as natural as opposed to coming across as forced like on network sitcoms and other cable comedies. The writers are also the stars and executive producers of the show, which gives them almost complete control. Let's hope the writing staff doesn't change. I'd give ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" 9/10. It's one of the best shows one is ever likely to see on cable.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,
So awful it was sickening,It hardly resembles the 80s. It is like a bad/trashy version of wonder years. The mother is way too attached to her kids. It is a little weird. The references where not correct in the 80s. That whole scene where the little boy and grandpa was taking about breast and the little boy says he wants to smother his face in them. Absolutely sicken!!! He is like 10. What the heck is wrong with you people and panning a little girl body slowly passing her chest. One word Pedophiles. So it is OK to show little girls as sex objects?! Who see this as OK? This is what we teach our children. TV shows are really going down the drain. I wouldn't watch this crap of you paid me. Please do society a favor and cancel this crap!,The Goldbergs,2
Better late than never,"I'm way too late to the party on this show as INot since Home Improvement have I enjoyed a good family sitcom like I have, The Goldbergs. Not just because I'm a child of the 80's and can relate, but because I'm growing tired of big networks trying to shock an audience rather than simply offering to entertain them. Good, honest humor with a great cast and awesome music. Please make more shows like this one.",The Goldbergs,10
A little bit of doggie humour for everyone,"Max, an NYPDog, must go undercover in a Dog Show to bring a gang of animal smugglers to justice. He gets partnered with an incompetent FBI agent as his handler.,Yep - it's another live action, talking dogs movie where the animals (and most of the women) are a lot smarter than the men. There are enough laughs in it to keep both the children and the parents amused. It does make fun of itself too. Most of the other user reviews are highly polarised between 1s and 10s but I think the truth is in between.,There were news articles around at launch time that two scenes were going to be cut because they might, 'normalise groping.' When I watched the movie in the UK well after launch those scenes seemed to be still in it. In a dog show a vet will check all the animal's assets from teeth to tail and Max has to stay calm while the medic confirms that he's still got his nuts. The movie, 'Best in Show,' has the same gag and I don't think children will necessarily understand why it's funny. So; something else for you parents to explain, but hey: you're used to that.,I liked: the animation, the cute pooches, the tiger and the out-takes at the end.
I didn't like: The pigeons plus there are parts of the movie that have some extremely tight editing, the dialogue is too fast and any joke is thrown away.,If you're a dog person add 1 point. If you're a cat person subtract 2 points.",Show Dogs,6
Disturbing message of sexual compliance,"This movie is only slightly entertaining, parents should know, when the dog's genitals are groped by the show organizers, he doesn't' like it, and is told he needs to just deal with it and not complain to anyone (when he is being ""checked out"")....he is told to find his happy place and just bear it, that it will be over soon. Terrible message for kids in my opinion. Wonder what pedophile will use this as an example the next time they are grooming their victims. I'm all for artistic freedom, but this is a really creepy message. It's a message like so many women have been victim of in Hollywood....you want to get in the show, you better let me do what I want. But it's even worse that it is geared toward children. They ""humanize"" these animals so kids can relate to them....and then send this creepy, not so subliminal message.",Show Dogs,1
This show is great,"Seriously, The true show that begs comparison to Seinfeld. Like the tag says its Seinfeld on crack, weirdest crazy situations that you can oddly relate to in some psychotic parallel universe.,Awesome show i also like how its made by a few buddies and then FX picked it up and it took off.,Try it, You'll LOVE IT,Also i love the group of friends in it their personalities reflect so funnily on each other which makes it seem like Seinfeld in such a likeness.,Also begs comparison to friends but friends was never this funny.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Refreshingly modern comedy,"If you scour the lowest rated reviews for this show you'll only hear criticism in the form of 'it's not funny' with little or no justification.,I think the reason for this is exactly the same reason behind similar criticism for 'The office' here in UK - which is that some people just don't get it.,The boring out-dated premise for comedy is unrealistically happy young people getting into mishaps followed by feel good endings all round - e.g/ Scrubs, Friends, Big Bang Theory - Boring.,The premise for It's always sunny is narcissistic and selfish characters on the upper edge of youth trying to make everything about themselves to their own detriment.,In other words, we've gone in completely the opposite direction to the status quo, which comedy SHOULD. The addition of Danny DeVito who's synonymous with 'old school' is just the icing on the cake, well done Danny for 'getting it' and for contributing to something genuinely funny and original!",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
"It doesn't get much weirder and goofier than this... OH, and awesome too!","This show is a mind-blow with each new episode... And it's one of those show that gets better with every season, so if You like the first season, stick with it, the show will knock You down laughing so hard, that You'll have a six pack before being done with season 3 :D One of the funniest shows ever! If You have a developed sense of humor, and i am not talking about one of those laugh-track scum that can be found out there...,P.S. - I wonder what is going on in their minds when they are writing scripts for the show, if the show has one, because it all seems so naturally improvised.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Lazy writing and/or just neglecting research on the '80s,"Yes...some others have said it here before that the people who seem to hate this show the most are the ones who grew up in the '80s. I don't have a problem with a show about the '80s, but it has to be ACCURATE and not lazy. The show has to make me feel like I'm really watching something from the '80s..but this show didn't do that at all. I won't knitpick too much as others have already pointed out the flaws, but here's one example. In one episode, they're talking about watching the TV show ""That's Incredible"", which stopped airing in 1984 or so. Then in the next 5 minutes, the grandpa talks to the young boy that he should watch ""How Harry Met Sally"" ....a movie that was released in 1989? Come on....no wonder they keep saying ""19 eighty something""...so, that they can just keep the whole decade open to referencing...but you know, it doesn't work that way. There must be consistency in period shows. Do you think 2001 was the same period as 2009? Of course not. Another reviewer pointed out that the boy says the ""only one who understands him is Flavor Flav""...get out of here. White people didn't know about Flavor Flav until probably after 1989 or 1990 when Public Enemy really started hitting mainstream (""911 is a joke"" was circa 1990). Lazy writing....won't watch it again unless I happen to leave the TV on while I take a nap.",The Goldbergs,3
Hilarious,"We love this show. I can see how there are people who are turned off by this show, though. It takes a certain off beat sense of humor to get it.,I would say it's best described as a mash up of The Wonder Years, That 70's Show, and Roseanne. They do yell a lot. But you know what? I know families who are like that. Yes, the mother is overly attached. People, helicopter parenting didn't begin in 2005.,The writer of the show actually videotaped his family in the 80's and this is what the show is based on. His actual family life. They show clips of the original home videos as the credits roll.,I don't know if this show is going to make but we'll enjoy it while it lasts.",The Goldbergs,10
Obvious paid reviews on here,I saw a free advanced screening of this movie and my god. Terrible literally doesn't even begin to describe this utter garbage. If you want to watch an actual good dog show comedy watch BEST IN SHOW by Christopher Guest. That's a genius film. If you think Scooby Doo is funny then you'll probably like this but if you are into actual comedies then skip this atrocity and watch Best in Show.,Show Dogs,1
What more can you ask for?,"A cheap show, a crazy gang, a lot of guts to say whatever they want, what more can I ask for? I came across sunny the first time on IMDb and was really surprised with the rating it had. beforehand the title seemed a little too lame for me to care for, but man, if I'd known what I was missing out on...,Sunny is interesting in a many ways, the production doesn't stand out as perfect especially for the first couple of episodes and it's almost like a bunch of good friends just talking nonsense for quite a long time, but then the comedy kicks in, the racial jokes, the waitress, Charlie's illiteracy, Mac's karate moves, Dennis' pride and Dee being ignored over and over again, they all seem to make sense after a while and God, are they funny! The beginnings have always been a favorite point for me when the gang starts talking about nothing and they start screaming and everything.,And also let's not forget about Danny Devito and his sick twisted way of treatment of others.,So don't miss out on this great little show!",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Perfect Show for anyone having a bad day,"These guys have made me a happier person for 6 years. I honestly can say no other TV show makes my day like ""IASIP"" for 6 years people have shunned this show and doubted the actors. Well, IMDb show that many people rate this show as a piece of art because that's what it is. People that don't find this show funny are just plain dull. That or they don't like todays comedy. All the other comedies on TV don't amount to this. Sure, maybe they do in awards but ""IASIP"" isn't built for the popularity contest, in the DVD's the actors come out and say they like the fans the fans are what moves them. That is the truth many, many, many people love this show. And they keep it moving currently 6 seasons going strong! Keep up the good work Mac, Dennis, Dee, Frank were watching.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Very disappointing,"I had read good reviews. 8.2 average on IMDb as I write this...,I was very disappointed when I started watching and realized that it is a collection of the laziest family sitcom tropes, without much heart and no laughter. The idea of humor is actors shouting every time they speak.,It's supposedly inspired in the childhood of the creator, so that makes it difficult for me to understand why it is so generic and lacking personality.,A disappointment. I like family sitcoms, but this is very low quality. I mean, when you make a nostalgic family/childhood sitcom with the child character narrating as an adult, you are competing with The Wonder Years, and The Goldbergs can not hold a candle to that show. Don't lose time with this, just go watch The Wonder Years instead.",The Goldbergs,
Golden-not!,"The goldbergs started out innocent and relatively funny,but now it is just annoying! The only actor I still like is Jeff garlin,because he reminds me of the golden age of comedy,but that's about it! The mother is the worst part of the show,because she is obnoxious and over-protective! Adam is no better! I understand this is based on his life,but you don't have to be annoying about it!",The Goldbergs,2
Painfully obnoxious and insulting,"Never have I seen a show that cries for cancellation more than this piece of dreck. The acting was over-the-top bad, the cast is as miscast as it gets. Who's that Johnny Galecky wannabe anyway. The only thing he's missing are horn rim glasses and a myopic squint. Oy vey, The original Goldbergs of the 1950's was insulting enough, but this? It's That 70's show a decade later and even more dysfunctional than the last ten years. You should live so long that a show like this will make it thru the summer. This stale piece of kreplach should never have made it through the first pitch session, what were you people thinking? And when did my mother ever say ""dick hair""? Come on, all those beeps. This isn't entertainment, it's excrement.",The Goldbergs,
Warning: not for children,"I can't believe I have to write this, but parents need to be warned that there are actual child grooming messages in this movie. ,The entire success of the main dog's mission rests on him overcoming his trauma about having his genitals inspected, and acquiescence to being interfered with by an authority figure. I kid you not. ,There are several questionable scenes encouraging him to disassociate while being traumatised 'down there', and then when he eventually submits the trauma is painted as wonderful. I cannot believe this movie was allowed to be made let alone released and marketed to children. I am surprised there isn't more of an uproar about it.,The rest of the movie is also unfunny and boring. So it's not for adults either.",Show Dogs,1
No.,"If you want a good movie about dogs, don't watch this. Instead, watch ""Isle of Dogs"". This is legit the worst movie I've seen so far this year and I sat through all of Truth or Dare.",Show Dogs,1
I liked it!,Saw this with my kids and I have to admit I actually quite enjoyed it. In the marketing this looked like simply another dumb kids movie but I was pleasantly surprised by the intelligent humour which left me chuckling a few times. There were a few jokes aimed at the adults too and I appreciate that the filmmakers had more than just the kids in mind. Glad I saw it and it's an 8/10 from me.,Show Dogs,8
Hilarious Television,"Never have I ever seen a television show with such unlikeable main characters. Never have I ever seen a television show with such unlikeable characters that amused me beyond belief. This show is one of the best shows on TV right now, and it is all due to the superb writing and acting, and directing.,The show follows the unbelievable but strangely everyday occurrences of ""The Gang"" in a what seems to be failing Philadelphia pub. What happens everyday are outrageously hilarious situations these characters get themselves into, for instance in one episode, two characters try become drug addicts just to be put on welfare. Every episode is extremely original, and it never seems to get old. ,There are many reasons to laugh at this show. One of them is the joke after joke formula, never trying to hard to be funny. The other thing that makes you laugh at this show is how you can tell this cast loves making this show, and how you can tell they have just as much fun making the show as how much fun the actual show is.,If you haven't seen this show, I beg you to give it a shot. I guarantee you will not be disappointed if you enjoy purely funny TV.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Always Sunny - Always Funny,"The show is great! I love the edgy humor and how they're addressing everyday issues and finding the hilarity in them. I think what I enjoy the most is that they're not tip-toeing around issues, gay, abortion, underage drinking (no, they're not promoting these, they're just addressing them). The way they have the real life situations and the true reactions within a set of friends sets this show apart (Seinfeld anyone?)...there's no following the lives of multi-millionaire brats as lead characters (fill in the blank for that show, there's only about 5 on air right now), none of the worn out ""the city is going to blow up unless you catch the bad guy in 5 minutes"" plot lines...it's real situations and almost everyone can relate...and laugh at.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,
painfully self aware,"This program screams ""Look at how much I grew up in the 80s!!!"" it is full of ""overtly subtle"" references to the era I was supposed to take place in. It is really disappointing to see so many people that I have respected in the past from the field of comedy (Patton Oswalt, Wendy McLendon-Covey, Jeff Garlin, George Seagal,) have signed on for a completely uninspired and forced show that is way to self aware. Unfortunately someone in the boardroom had the idea to slap together another nostalgia piece that just wasn't needed. We went through 1998- 2010 doing the ""pre/post millennial nostalgia kick"" and it is time to move on. Stations like AMC, FX and the Pay channels have started showing the way of where TV is heading, network keeps pumping out tired old shows and themes again and again. I really can't wait for this thing to be canceled, it is utterly terrible.",The Goldbergs,1
this show was so 80 min ago...  take the kid out you and you have nothing,"I was excited to see some 80 things and sayings but all i saw was a bunch of people yelling at each other. Do the producers think that in 2013 we have become so scared of kids that we don't yell at them? That is not an 80 thing. Pac man is and arcades. I know you probably didn't want to have to pay music records royalties but you need to have some music from the 80's . Oh and the jeep at the end was a new 2000 wrangler. Most shows about the 80 show parents working like 6 jobs and not giving a rip about the kids.,This is the same as the show THE MIDDLE but with old outfits on. But the middle is funny after 4 years.

ignore the bad press and enjoy a wonderful movie,"""Show Dogs"" (PG, 1:32) is an action-adventure comedy which was directed by Raja Gosnell, who has two Smurfs movies, two Scooby-Doo movies, ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"", ""Big Momma's House"" and ""Never Been Kissed"" on his resume. The film was written by Max Botkin (""What Happened to Monday"") and Marc Hyman (""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"") and produced using a combination of live action and CGI. It has, unfortunately, also been the subject of some controversy. Some people have interpreted one canine character's struggle to learn how to deal with being handled during competition as some secret message teaching children to accept fondling. This minor subplot could also be interpreted as encouraging men not to be afraid of prostate exams. Or maybe it's just a relevant plot point for an alpha dog preparing to be in his first dog show. Either way, the rest of this review will ignore the controversy and talk about the movie, which is more than a bad press magnet.,Max (voiced by Ludacris) is a Rottweiler working as a tough-as-nails NYC police dog. Max is tracking some rare animal smugglers when he runs into Frank (Will Arnett), an FBI agent working on the same case. Max's human supervisor convinces a reluctant Frank to work with Max on their joint venture. The two new partners develop a love-hate relationship as they follow the clues to Las Vegas, where they believe an international dog show there is being used as a front by the animal traffickers. A dog groomer named Mattie (Natasha Lyonne) works with Frank as he poses as a dog handler participating in the competition. Of course, Max is forced to endure the indignities of a primped pooch paraded about during the various challenges in the dog show as he does his own undercover work. Along the way, Max gets help from an unhinged former champion named Dante (Alan Cumming) and a fellow participant named Daisy (Jordin Sparks). RuPaul, Gabriel Iglesias, Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley Tucci also voice CGI dogs, while Anders Holm, Blake Anderson and Kate Micucci voice a trio of pigeons who are fans of Max.,""Show Dogs"" is cute, clever, comedic and compassionate. Sure, this movie could be seen as just another man and mutt police pairing, in the vein of ""Turner and Hooch"" and ""K9"" (both from 1989), or a hairy rehash of 2000's ""Miss Congeniality"", but those comparisons really do a disservice to this delightful comedy. The story is simple enough for most kids to follow, but involved enough to hold the interest of most adults. The voice work is great and the performances and plot combine to make for a very enjoyable (mostly) family-friendly film. ""A-""",Show Dogs,8
Wag your tail for Show Dogs,"If you are a dog owner or had one in the past, you can relate to the collage of canines presented in the comedy ""Show Dogs."" This Raja Gosnell-directed film is a light-hearted delight showcasing the poochy world of man's best friends communicating amongst themselves. The plot is a little thin, and the wackiness could be amped slightly higher, but scriptwriters Max Botkin and Marc Hyman have supplied enough jokes to keep a smile on the viewer's face throughout. Ideal for the entire family, SD is a film that even mom and dad can enjoy with the kids, which is rare in today's movie theaters.",Show Dogs,8
side splitting at times,I can only only assume the negative reviews for this show comes from the people who find such programs as 'mike and molly' 'big bang theory' and '2 and a half men' funny and rely on canned laughter to tell them when something just funny has happened. I must admit i stumbled across this program whilst in bed in Vegas wishing i hadn't started drinking in the day and it made me vomit with laughing...i'm not usually a huge fan of US comedies as they are few and far between but when one comes along like this it baffles me that there is that much crap on US TV?!?! The characters are perfect together and whilst at 1st was dubious about DeVito's role i've grown to him and think he's perfect too. More like this America and you'll be forgiven for the amount of terrible alleged comedies you roll out and 'reality'....if you can call them reality rubbish.,It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
"Crude, rude, funny, hilarious and far out pushes the comedy limit. Shows you don't have to be serious in life, one of TV's best!","Over the years on FX I would tune in and catch an episode of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" from time to time. Only eventually it would be just like getting hooked on something as now I'm a faithful viewer of the series it's just like a religion. And who wouldn't be hooked the series it pushes the envelope it's far out funny and crude and rude as it just doesn't give a hoot and all of the characters are risk takers and speak it like it is about the world as I agree with them it's time we come down on this society more as it's became to much of a yes man and politically correct one. And the chemistry between the actors and guest is top notch. As it's a watch for the legendary Danny Devito who shines here as he proves he's not to good to do a cable comedy sitcom after being in many big screen movies it doesn't affect his legendary status.,Anyhow it was created by Rob McElhenney(who plays Mac)and many episodes were directed by Fred Savage(""The Wonder Years"")as it's set in the city of brotherly love Philadelphia, PA. And always the opening sequences get you into the mood well by showing city landmarks from Market Street, the Rocky statue, and Lincoln Financial Field. So you feel that Philly freedom! The plot and storyline aside from just four grown friends having a ball of fun, is centered around Danny Devito who as Frank Reynolds is still in Philadelphia with his two grown kids Dennis(Glenn Howerton)and Dee(Kaitlin Olson)and they hang out with Charlie(Charlie Day)and Mac(Rob McElhenney)who are two grown slacker men who've been friends since childhood. And all four of the grown adults gets their kicks and meetings together at the Irish pub bar they run called ""Paddy's"".,And thru the years the series has provided some funny and crazy moments of themes that center around road trips, medical problems, relationship problems, alcohol contests with rival bars, stalking, protest, crazy inventions, illegal immigration, and just down right good old funny fashioned fun with the gang pushing the limits and rules of not only just the law but society also. Overall this series is never boring or dull with it's wacky and crazy far out themes that's what makes it so watchable and likable is that it's different! Really a wonderful series one of the best on TV as it proves with it's comedy and raunchy fun that it's okay to be crude, rude, and outspoken in a crazy and envelope pushing way! Glad to see a show that speaks to society in a blunt and feel good fashion proving not to take life serious as it's okay to have fun your way.

Hilarious show,"The series follows ""The Gang"", a group of five depraved underachievers: twins Dennis and Deandra ""Sweet Dee"" Reynolds, their friends Charlie Kelly and Mac, and Frank Reynolds, Dennis and Dee's adoptive father, who runs Paddy's Pub, a run-down bar in South Philadelphia. They are dishonest, egotistical, lazy, manipulative and vengeful. Episodes usually find them hatching elaborate schemes, conspiring against one another and others for personal gain, vengeance, or simply for the entertainment of watching each other's downfall. Their tactics often rely on inflicting emotional and sometimes physical and psychological pain on individuals both deserving and undeserving. They regularly use blackmail and manipulate one another and others outside of the group.,Much like in Seinfeld, the plots and schemes hatched by the Gang rarely result in lasting success; indeed, oftentimes, the plans backfire to adversely affect the group or at least, leave the Gang back at square one with little to no gain.,This show is hilarious. Watch it now.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
Another Dumb show to Dumb Audiences,"I was raised on Family Ties, Growing Pains, Full House and the Wonder Years. Unfortunately as we have (d)evolved over the years so has television degenerated and been dumbed down to entertain an ignorant mass of people.,Five Reasons this show sucks! 1) It's not funny 2) It is hyper-sexual in ways that are- again- not funny, or productive in any way. If it was at least sexual to make a point about sexuality - but no- its just blatantly perverse and disgusting how the character of the grandfather comments in the pilot that the daughter ""with her looks-can get a ride from any boy she wants"" and later teaches the 11 year old kid to lie to his parents to go and pick up girls at a diner. It's really trashy- but not like Married with Children-trashy- rather trashy like bad writing, not funny, not insightful, boring, and offensive- kind of trash television.,3) the characters are over the top ""stock"" characters. The mother is an overbearing woman who is hard to believe is a human being because it is written so over the top that it is impossible to buy into it as a viewer. The father verbally offends the kids, calls them: idiots, morons, etc. all of which perpetuates bad parenting through mainstream media. I don't understand how calling a child stupid or an idiot is supposed to be funny? Words are powerful and when used so mindlessly in a show that is watched by ignorant people, it can only perpetuate more ignorance. I just don't understand what the point is of this show.,4) It's boring and the viewer does not feel invested in any of the characters. Because the characters and situations are so over the top, the viewer cannot get into the show or relate to what is happening and therefore, we could care less and get bored easily by what is happening on the screen.,5) the writing is over the top, and bad.",The Goldbergs,1
Spoiler Elert...........Did I really hear that???????,"First off, I grew up in the sixties and by no means led a sheltered life. I have also been blessed with the uncanny ability to find something funny about any situation. Maybe it is due to the fact that our family life was earlier but we only thought the show to be ""borderline"" funny,with a whole lot of screaming going on and not a whole lot of comedy. Grandpa seemed to be quite the pervert the way he was describing how to handle the tween girl behind the counter. We all look forward to the new shows that preview in the fall and have a little pool to see which ones will ""make it"". Unfortunately, I have to give this one 5 weeks in our dead show pool. That being said, did anyone have a hard time answering the question ""what's a jag-off?"" to the kids in the room when it was used in reference to the clerk at Sam Goode's? That folks, was a first for me on network PRIMETIME television.",The Goldbergs,2

"The most complete comedy, ever.","It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a unique comedy. The show's humor can range from subtle and intelligent, as seen in shows like Arrested Development, to outrageously, raucous, and to some outright offensive.,Much like Seinfeld, IASiP is a show that takes a normal situation, and, with it's hilarious characters, creates an insanely, original ending. Much to the show's own benefit, the actors,aside from Danny Devito, started as basically nobodies. In fact, the original four were friends before the show, and their chemistry shines through their performances( however this isn't to say that Devito doesn't mesh with the original four ). One of the show's few downsides, however, is that the character's need some getting used to in order to establish their places in the show and understand their sense of humor. On the other hand, this sacrificed time period will result in the best viewer to character connection a person can find in a comedy.,I hear tons of people say that IASiP is ""Seinfeld on crack"", but, as accurate a statement as that is, I would much rather say it's what you would see if the brute, crudeness of the Chappelle's Show was juxtaposed with Arrested Development.",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
What a Show,"Despite the fact that I'm not a child of the 80's, having been born in the 90's, I have to say I freaking love this show. The main reason it has quickly become my favorite thing to watch is because of its characters. All of the main Goldberg family are likable and relatable in their own ways and this really helps the show, also in a rarity for these shows, the supporting cast are equally as interesting, I'm a massive Dave Kim fan. I also find that the stories in each episode are great because they are also relatable and have a meaning behind them, it truly captures the heart of growing up in a way that not many shows do and this is a major bonus. I find that its very rare nowadays to find a sitcom that has as much heart as this one, largely due to the fact that they decide to focus on characters like the young bachelor dating a supermodel, but what helps it is the fact that everybody can relate to having a family that annoys them. For me this is one of the best shows on the air and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking about watching regardless of age. A fun filled show about a realistic everyday family that has clearly been made with a lot of love.",The Goldbergs,8
Possibly the worst television show ever made.,"Awful writing. Pathetic, amateur directing. Talentless ""acting"". Sad, bland set design. Boring costume. All of this is topped by the most random, inconsistent casting in the history of motion picture technology. This random collection of people look as related to one another as the Village People. ,I want to thank those at ABC for showing the world what our crippled education system is doing to our society. Hopefully this show will trigger a new drive to repair our schools, lower college costs and generally educate people - ultimately erasing this kind of stupidity once and for all.,In the meantime, I'd be interested to see which is worse for your brain - one viewing of this show or binge drinking gasoline. Anyone know the answer?",The Goldbergs,1
"No, No, Noooo! They Got It All Wrong!","There are way to many errors in this show for it to be set in the 1980s. Did the writers even research what they referencing in the show? Two-tone jeans, slap wraps, Hypercolor, and Reebok Pumps all belong to the early 90s. No one knew of Kid N' Play until 1990 when House Party was in Theaters. The writers will ram anything in there just to remind viewers that it was the 1980s. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who caught the Flavor Flav mention in 1985, FOLKS. I'll say that again. ""No one gets me, but Flavor Flav"", said by Barry Goldberg in 1985! I don't ever remember seeing AmToys Madballs in an arcade claw machine. Some episodes are too unrealistic also. Who sees ""Say Anything"" and then holds up a Ghetto Blaster at someone's' house. No one in the 1980s tried such a thing. They were very heavy. I'm think the one Lloyd Dobbler had was a fake set piece. The dining room just isn't what a one in the 1980s would look like. The only objects that seem retro in the entire show are Adam's toys. I cannot think of any child that thought to save the G.I. Joe All American Hero USS Flagg box around. I was alive in the 1980s, as you can tell. My generation usually tossed the boxes after 10 minutes or so. There is no way Adam Goldberg rented ""How Harry Met Sally"" in late '89. In the real 1989, most people were still renting flicks from 1988. So, in that case, ""198x"" would have had to have been 1992. The child actor who plays Adam comes off as too mature for his age. Like Surviving Jack, the writers just cobbled anything together and called it ""That 80s Show"". Heck, ""That 80s Show"" captured the feel of the mid 1980's over this babble. I have this a 5/10 because the adult actors managed to make me bust out a few laughs every now and then, especially Jeff Garlin and George Segal. I'll stick with ""Everybody Hates Chris"" or a film from the 1980s like ""The Princess Bride""(earliest part) over this.",The Goldbergs,5
I was actually entertained!,"I usually hate kid movies. Almost all of them, especially animated ones. I didn't have any expectations going into this, but the jokes were actually pretty funny and it was a cute storyline. People are always going to hate on movies like this but it's not made for adults. It's a kids movie, and a pretty good one at that. If you're looking for a cute funny movie with really adorable animals, go see it! You might be surprised.",Show Dogs,10

It's always Sunny...,"Think South Park in South Philly. Danny Devito does just enough to anchor the cast but still allows the younger and lesser known co-stars to develop their characters around him. Often times, a more established actor with Devito's credentials will wash out the co-stars and smother the show. This is not the case with Sunny. Put simply, this show works. It may take another solid season for this show to cultivate a substantial core audience. But it seems FX is willing to stick with it long enough to find out. Even if FX decides to run this show up against the big boys (CBS' ""Without a Trace"") in the fall, Thursdays at 10pm is a perfect time slot. Sunny is gritty and dark at times, but in a harmless and smart kind of way. Kudos, FX...This show is a winner!",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10
One of the Greatest Comedies Ever,"The show has tailed off a bit over its last few seasons, but what show hasn't in its 7th and 8th seasons? The fact that they aren't doing most of the writing surely doesn't help either. For the people who have only recently come across the show due to its growing popularity, I highly recommend you watch its earlier seasons.,The early to middle seasons of this show are pure brilliance. The wit, timing, satire and chemistry between the characters is one of the best if not the best I have ever seen in a comedic cast. ,I cannot express how much I love this show. It seems every time I watch an episode again I somehow find it even more funny which I didn't think was possible.,In its prime the show is as close to perfect as a comedy can get",It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,10

It's Always Sunny In My House!,"I admit, I was late to the game. I began watching Sunny when Comedy Central started to air it.,Initially, I didn't get it -- at all.

And then I experienced it, ""The Nightman Cometh""...the episode that changed it all for me!

I bought the Six Pack (Seasons 1-5 & ""A Very Sunny Christmas""), Season 6 and I even ended up buying the soundtrack. I caught up to it within a few weeks and I am hooked! ,This is not your typical (boring) cast of characters and the fact that they do not fit the typical (predictable) sitcom mold is what makes it so darn excellent!

"""It just started and I already want it to be over!"" -my inner thoughts.","Show Dogs is a movie from the ""lauded"" director of the Scooby-Doo and The Smurfs 1 and 2. This movie tells of a police dog named Max and his human partner Frank, played by Will Arnett who attend a dog show in Vegas in order to go undercover to rescue a baby panda. Along the way, Frank tries to keep Max in the dog show with the help of Mattie played by Natasha Lyonne.,I went to this movie expecting it to be another bad family film with loud, obnoxious characters, ""cool and hip"" humor and a by the numbers plot. However, I went in with the slightest bit of optimism that it'd not be something like that. As soon as it begun though, I realized that this was exactly what I was picturing in my head.,When the movie opens with the dog staking out the crime, I knew what I was in for. The dialogue for this movie is nonstop. It's snappy, fast paced, is just annoying and hardly ever stops. There were some moments near the end that were fairly quiet and calm. Most of the movie, however consisted of rambling, nonstop dialogue, which is a problem indicating that the characters in this movie will not shut up. That's my biggest complaint with the film, plain and simple.,It's a highly unfunny movie generally speaking. Most of the jokes revolve around pop culture humor, gas humor, screaming and many other things you would find annoying. As a matter of fact, since there were only 2 other people in the theater, whenever a ridiculously bad joke was made, I laughed hysterically while frowning. This occurred notably when there was a pop culture gag like when one of the dogs dabbed, in a 2018 movie. The humor is just lowbrow and annoying.,The plot is, like I said, a by the numbers kids movie plot. It's a detective plot, you know how it will end, there's really nothing else to talk about.,The only decent aspect of the movie is that the human actors put in effort into their roles. Arnett and Lyonne put on good enough performances to make this atrocity of a movie slightly redeemable. Although I'm not sure why they hired celebrities for characters that would appear fora couple minutes like with RuPaul.,Overall, this movie is nothing. There's no reason for this to exist; we've seen plenty of kids movies with pandering humor, predictable stories and plain annoyance. It's also pretty laughable how it's out during a time when we have big releases in theaters like Infinity War, Deadpool and soon to be Solo: A Star Wars Story. Skip this movie.,2/10",Show Dogs,2
You'll be hard pressed to find a bigger waste of your movie dollars,"Talking dogs, talking babies, talking cars. There usually only one good movie ever made but they continue to try. Thankfully, this will forever make it harder to finance a talking dog movie. Don't get me wrong, Ludacris was funny as Max, the streetwise canine cop. Casting did their job as many voices were spot on but with no script, direction and inferior production values, they had no chance. The CGI was mildly inventive but the rest was awful.",Show Dogs,1
Bear in mind the target audience.,"I personally didn't think much of this movie. It's of a genre (talking animal) which isn't my cup of tea. However, the two 9 year old girls I took to watch it, loved it and were thoroughly entertained from start to finish. I have seen much better movies of this type, but I have also seen so much worse. It really isn't half as bad as some of the scathing reviews on here would have you believe. There was certainly plenty of laughter in the screen we were sat in from both kids and adults, so I'm not alone in my opinion.,If you don't have kids 13 or younger, maybe think twice about this one, but otherwise it was a perfectly fine way to keep a pair of kids entertained for a couple of hours.",Show Dogs,7

The Best New Show of 2014,"I came in with trepidation. The whole premise is preposterous. How wrong could I have been? Turns out very.,""Jane the Virgin"" (still not thrilled with the title) is beyond charming. The lead actress is adorable and so believable -- even in this jaded age. The switching between English and Spanish dialog (please don't change this; Americans don't like sub-titles but the gimmick works) -- muy excelente! The very witty writing about cultural mores, traditional and contemporary, is something very missing in today's entertainment. I caught a repeat episode of ""Mike and Molly"" the other night (I've only seen the first episode and did not laugh once) and was reminded of the raw, crude language that completely turned me off; that is not comedy. Yet, it is the norm today, unfortunately.,Go ahead and take the plunge -- give ""Jane the Virgin"" a try. She will steal your heart; she already has mine.",Jane the Virgin,9
Refreshing and phenomenal. A perfect mix of TV culture.,"Coming from a country that airs cheap telenovela, it's refreshing to watch an improved everything of what a telenovela should be. ,Jane the Virgin is one of the shows that do not care what the current audience wants to see / is interested to see. The plot is in itself far away from what a typical viewer is interested to watch. The plot is outrageous and in the nature of telenovelas. The creators made the show at high stakes but they also reaped greater rewards. ,The cast is perfect. Each cast can carry a scene a telenovela would but with a very ""American TV-show"" feel. The fact the they are all talented, beautiful, and god-help-me-I'm-dying-of-laughter funny can't hurt.,What I hate about telenovelas (Aside from seeing them 5 times a week, yes, 5 times a week ) is the repetitiveness and pacing. That's not a problem with this show. I like how the show foreshadow scenes and repeat scenes with very minor but very impactful changes. The ""American TV-show"" pace is perfect too. ,I just can say that if you like watching TV shows but is kind of bored of the mainstream vampires, sci-fi, superheroes, crime, teen girl, drama, kind. You might just be blown away with this gem of a show. This show need more hype.",Jane the Virgin,9
Fresh and humorous,"It's presented in a comedic style that isn't meant to be taken seriously. I've seen others that commented that there was nothing funny about the situation and wondered why she didn't sue the doctor....as I stated....it is a COMEDY. If this were a reality show, it would have to involve lawyers, investigators and medical professionals. Nothing about this show feels like reality. It is presented as entertainment. I found it entertaining. It is based on an earlier Spanish version that had the lead character as a 17 year old girl, which is way more realistic if she is supposed to be a virgin. However the fact that the lead in this version is 24 adds to the humor. How many 24 year old educated attractive women in a serious relationship with a guy in law enforcement determined to stay a virgin until marriage could there be? Just saying....I think if you like a good mystery (this show also has suspense) and satire, I think this show is worth checking out. It doesn't hurt that all the actors are very attractive.",Jane the Virgin,9
Perfect,"After completing the first season of this show, I have to say it's definitely one of my favorites. It's interesting and not something typical of other shows, since the storyline is so twisted. There for awhile, it felt like keeping up with everything that was happening in the season was going to be difficult, but it's definitely not if it is something that you find interesting. If you find it interesting, you'll be glued to the TV/computer until you finish it, and then bawl your eyes out, maybe. It's not too hard to keep up with, but the storyline is unique and perfect for those who are in their late teens through early 30's, in my personal opinion.",Jane the Virgin,9
A soap any like other,"I have a disclaimer, ""I do not like soaps at all"". Every soap that I accidentally saw growing up with my family made me realize why I hated soaps. Why am I telling all this? Because ""Jane the Virgin"", is unlike any other soap I have ever seen. Most soaps are boring, tedious, unnecessary twists, stretched, overly dramatic and too serious or trying too hard to be funny. The best thing about this show is that it avoids all of these mistakes.,This show can be taken and is a good satire on soaps in general and telenovellas in particular but it also has merits of its own. It doesn't solely rely on making fun on other soaps to be successful. It is genuinely funny and has enough twists to keep the audience engaged. Also the little messages the show gives in a few moments in every other episode are real and relatable to us average mortals.,The show also has a wonderful take on life in general. It tells us that we should not take our lives too seriously and not everything is in our control. We think most of the times that we are the leaders of our destiny and we can shape our lives any way we want. Yes to a certain extent we can but we should never rule our environment and the part played by it in our destiny. The show even goes a step beyond this general realization that I stated, it teaches us how with all the unexpected turns and twists in life we keep growing and moving on and life never stops. This is the sort of outlook on life the show promotes and it is a very good message in my opinion. Every one should watch this show! :)",Jane the Virgin,8
love this show,"I absolutely love this, the Spanish and English, the funny jokes, the chemistry all of it. Finally something Latin that I love to watch. I'm hooked. Love it. Why aren't there more funny shows like this ? I hate having to wait until Monday to watch it but it's worth the wait. I also like the fact that they showcase certain traditions that Latin families still try to keep in this generation. I just simply enjoy the show and I've even gotten friends and family to watch. I have to say that my favorite Characters are Jane, the grandmother, the mother and of course Rafael. The dialog is fun to watch and you can relate to some of the characters also.",Jane the Virgin,10
On a steady decline across all the dimensions,"Have just binged watched over the last couple of weeks, from episode 1 to episode 29 and sadly, as fun as the beginning was--it is on a slow and steady decline. It is clearly a telenovela, and amusing as such. A definite departure from credibility, but fun. ,However, by episode 29, Jane is simply an annoying as a character--her lack of common sense (despite the narrator's description otherwise), her naiveté, her stubbornness and self-righteousness --all come together to make her very unappealing. I can't imagine why either Michael or Rafael are in love with her even in suspended reality. ,On the other hand, one can see why both Michael and Rafael are interesting and desirable mates. They both have more passion and intensity as characters.,The other characters are simply fun. ,Overall, the acting is great, but the script writers need to find some way to make the main character, Jane, charming again. Because right now it's a drag to watch her, and the other characters can't carry the show alone.",Jane the Virgin,7
A fresh new comedy about an impossible situation,"This is a fresh new comedy about a girl who, without having a single sexual intercourse, ends-up pregnant and by a man who knew and was in love with him.,I'm spoiling you just a little (!) because the series, right from the start doesn't insist on presenting the fact as an immaculate conception or some other kind of miracle.,This a modern comedy with engaging visuals and without a pre-recorded laugh track.,The actors are good enough and although the series is in English, there are lots of dialogs in Spanish that for me adds to the comedic element of the show because of the way the actors are delivering their lines AND the ""Latin Lover"" narrator.,I only saw the pilot and as I said the solution to the mystery on why Jane got pregnant without having sex is given a couple minutes after the fact. It may be a miss opportunity for a couple of episodes there, where Jane's grandmother (a woman with strong religious beliefs), could be insisted that the pregnancy was a miracle, gather the neighbors to pray etc. but the writers passed it from the beginning.,Good comedy so far. I'll watch the next episodes to see how it goes.",Jane the Virgin,
Love it...,"I stumble on this show and the name grabbed my attention so I decided to watch one episode...then another one...and the rest is history. It is a really good comedy show, a bit chaotic at times, but very entertaining. I truly love the Telenova Star (he is so good looking and play his part so well) and as well with Daddy Baby Rafaela - another pretty good looking dude! ,The narrator is doing a superb job in moving the story along with lots of humour and punch line. I don't think the show would be as good without the narrator job. ,The story by itself is very interesting, a virgin with a baby, but very believable on it's own. The surrounding cast is doing a pretty good job and one big thump up for ""Petra"" who is amazing in her role. With all the side-track stories and events within the main story, I tend to want to see less of ""Jane"" and more of the other actors as I feel they bring so much more to the show. Jane is Jane..and it feels that she is not evolving in her role, which is something the other characters have done. Overall, it's a great show..perfect binging show for a rainy Sunday afternoon, with wine and popcorn. Enjoy!",Jane the Virgin,9
This Should be Treated Like a Parody,"This series is basically a Spanish, soap opera parody. The narrator is the biggest and first clue. He will guide viewers into the scenes and episode scenario. From my perspective, he is there to help people who haven't seen Spanish soap operas. They put the characters into random emotional scenarios, except they're not so emotional. For example, the father comes into the daughters life after a 20+ year abstinence. In a soap opera, there would be crying and ""where were you my whole life"" drama. In Jane the Virgin, the father attempts to make that happen, but it fails hilariously. He goes out of his way to make it dramatically, but it ends up as an adult conversation over coffee. The biggest thing that makes this a parody is the fact the father is a Spanish soap opera star. There are scenes from his TV show that depict the stereo type soap opera drama, and this lets the viewer to compare it to the story. It is this compare and contrast that I love about the show. There are way to many dumb and horrible parody movies/TV shows. They always take it too far with the parody jokes. This show takes it good standard. It is believable, rational standard, and thus adds comedic humor to it. Every new episode I wonder, what dramatically event will appear, and how will they handle it rationally.",Jane the Virgin,10
Thoughtful comedy - likable if not a laugh a minute,"This is a thoughtful evenly paced comedy that is not a laugh a minute. It feels more like a light hearted drama. If you are looking for a Big Bang Theory laugh a minute thing then this isn't right.,The cast is likable if not 'Devious Maids' attractive. Gina is intelligent looking. Her chemistry with Justin Baldoni kind of wears thin after a while. Don't know if the romance plot can sustain another season. The voice over explanations help keep things moving along. It doesn't feel like a typical CW show - it feels less juvenile.,Surprised at the accolades at the Golden Globes.

Simpatico is the word that comes to mind here with the perfect lineup of writer, director and actress. The biggest question is how to label it.

There is 8/9 year old daughter Sarah (Lia Frankland, 6 year old son Jonah (Asher Miles Fallica) who lands on the autistic spectrum, and now an unplanned newborn that threatens to rock a family already barely getting through each day. Sarah is a lovely sister and daughter, but the typical adolescent insecurities are magnified by her getting lost in the shuffle due to her two more needy siblings. Jonah gets booted from mainstream kindergarten by a principal who labels him ""quirky"" ... an awkward description people use when they are trying to be polite (even though it's exactly the opposite). ,Ron Livingston plays Marlo's husband Drew, a traveling businessman who, though a nice guy and loving father, is clueless to the stresses of running the homestead. Also in the mix is Craig (Mark Duplass), Marlo's brother who is equal parts wealthy and smug. When Craig offers the gift of a night-nanny to Marlo, she is tempted, but her pride gets in the way as she compares herself to the 'cupcake' super moms who always seem to have their act together. Ultimately, the relentless pressure and sleep deprivation, bring the young night-nanny Tully (Mackenzie Davis) into the home. She and Marlo hit it off immediately leading Marlo (and us) to question if Tully is too good to be true.,As Tully entrenches herself, it becomes clear that her value is to Marlo more than the baby. The two ladies become friends, and Marlo confesses her fears and insecurities as Tully acts as a life coach encouraging her through some tough moments. Despite the surreal feel to these interactions, Diablo Cody's dialogue crackles with cynicism and realism. The quips we've come to expect from her writing are delivered by her best developed character to date. There is a depth to Marlo, and her exchanges with Tully take us places a teenage JUNO couldn't possibly.,Charlize Theron proves again that she is truly an elite actress when she commits to a role. Her 50 lb weight game adds the necessary realism, but it's her emotional teetering that is most impressive. She is like a supermodel who also plays rugby - a rare blend of beauty, talent and skill. Mackenzie Davis is a revelation. She holds her own in every scene and it's quite interesting to see her free-spirited modern day Mary Poppins with tats.,If a previous movie has dealt with the challenge and stress of motherhood with this level of depth and realism, it doesn't come to mind. The movie kind of creeps up on you with a message regarding the importance of dealing with lost youth, while also never losing sight of yourself as an individual ... all with incisive humor and pulling no punches on being an overwhelmed mom. Just don't call it quirky.",Tully,8
Amazing TV show!!!,"I am in love with ""Jane the Virgin"". I think it is a great show that portrays the Hispanic/Latino culture. I am not offended by this show because it definitely represents many aspects from my culture. This show represents the telenovelas just how the are ""full of drama"" and I love it! Jane the Virgin makes me want to look forward to my Mondays and although it was gone for more than a month I still look forward to seeing it. Gina Rodriguez, Jaime Camil and all the cast make a wonderful team and I as a viewer can tell how much chemistry there is between Jane and Micheal and Jane and Rafael. I love it! I hope they continue to renew the seasons because this show has become my favorite show :)",Jane the Virgin,10
"This show is great, but Czech Republic is NOT Russia!","I really really like this show - it's so funny, but the creators should find some consultant about Czech Republic!!! I am from Czech Republic and Czech people don't like when someone is thinking we are Russian (because of the bad history we have with Russia). So it makes me sad that in this great show are so many mistakes. For example: 1) Magda's accent is Russian - Czech people don't have an accent like that when they try to speak English 2) when the Czech characters speak ""Czech"", they are using so many Russian words - and the languages are not the same (not even close) 3) ""the traditional Czech wedding""(hope it's not a spoiler) WHAT?! They may have a weddings like that in Russia, but in Czech Republic we don't have some ugly traditional dress and hat for the bride and weird suit for the groom. It wasn't even funny. And there are so many more... I hope the creators could do something about it, because it spoils this great show for people who know something about Czech Republic.",Jane the Virgin,8
"Too perfect of a show. Everything ends up happy, happy joy joy","So guess what? In this TV series it is possible to be a mother of a three weeks baby, go to grad school full time, not have to work for a second and have two sexy men chasing you continuously, even after you telling them that you love them both. Ohhh did I forget to mention that both men re filthy rich? And one is a sexy, caring, romantic policeman???? Yeah, thats what Im saying, GET A GRIP!,The actors are somewhat funny, but the plot is ridiculous. While I know that this is just a TV show and not reality, i think the producers should really tone down the fiction in this movie. Portraying the life of Latino women and their success in life it's perfectly fine, but don't make it sound like Cinderella story. ,So if you feel like watching a fairytale with some close to sci fi adventures, this is your movie. But if you do not feel like being put down by a super mom, student a future to be someones very rich wife, just skip this and find some really cool action movie or a good comedy to really entertain yourself. Life is not as pink, women in Miami need to work their asses off and raise babies, not have their extremely young mother, grandmother, sexy man one and sexy man two and her father raising her three weeks old child.",Jane the Virgin,1
Fantastic,"Charlize was great, as always, and Mackenzie Davis was magical. It's a real-world take on Mary Poppins. Was really looking forward to this film and was not disappointed. Diablo Cody took a darker turn from Juno with Young Adult, which was darkly hilarious, and she again took a stark subject and sprinkled it with hope and a bit of whimsy. The film is not going to make you want to run out and become a mother but it also paints a more real look on how motherhood can be hard, stressful, seemingly impossible at times, but ultimately rewarding. It's not your glossy, magical look on motherhood, falsely advertised in most film and TV. I can't say much more on it without giving away the plot which needs to be seen for itself. But the themes they explore in the film are highly relatable for anyone whether they have kids or not. It will leave you thinking.",Tully,8
A supremely empathetic parental plea,"We're all familiar with the idea of the ""duality of man"", those two sides of who we are that are counter to each other yet together make up who we are. Tully explores the ""duality of woman"", specifically the juxtaposing intricacies of what can make someone both a stable mother and simply an older version of their youthful leanings. In that, this movie becomes a rare sort of mumblecore film: one with a purpose. Thematically rich, progressively sweet and artfully entertaining, it's a Reitman-Diablo Cody director-writer collaboration (Juno, Young Adult) that shows a clear growth in both of their crafts.
Theron (with volatile brilliance) plays an overwhelmed mother of three who hires a young, free-spirited night-nanny to help restore some normalcy and rest to her life. Playfully, this dramedy uses horror to show the all-consuming terror of being a parent. It uses action-style editing to reveal the speed with which life passes you by, especially when you start having kids. With cunning self-awareness, it utilizes the ""manic-pixie-dream-girl"" trope to show our lustful desire for our own past. Throughout, Cody's dialogue beams with hilarious and loving honesty, especially when leaning into the mundanity of family life.
Above all, I don't remember the last time I saw a film so succinctly capture both the freedom and imprisonment of growing old and settling down. Even when the film takes turns toward incredulity, it always finds its way back, supremely interested in the mental state of people experiencing traumatic changes, all while staying as funny as it is potent. A supremely empathetic parental plea, Tully is exactly the crowd-pleasing respite we need in the Thanos-conquered cinema landscape.",Tully,9
Absolutely Phenomenal,"Phenomenal and incredibly well-written. I completed entire Season 1 with in a week and still can't get over this show from my head. I am so glad i came across this series. It has lot of elements combined and it tickles your funny bone and quite a stress-reliever. very light-hearted series which keeps you get more and more addicted for every single episode. Entire Cast has performed exceptionally well. Justin Baldoni, Gina Rodriguez, Yael Grobglas, Ivonne Coll, Brett Dier, Jaime Camil, Vanessa Merrell and Veronica Merrell are top in my favorites list from the show. I am totally addicted to this series. Keep going!! Waiting for more and more seasons of ""Jane the Virgin"".",Jane the Virgin,10
Fresh and haunting at the same time,"It's a daunting task to do this film justice with mere descriptions of what it may or may not be about. One thing is clear, it is about motherhood, it is about identity, and about self-acceptance, but one could argue most films are about identity and self-acceptance, which leaves us with motherhood. ,It feels much more important to underline that Tully is a rare film with stunning writing and dialogue and acting, that takes the viewer through what it can feel like to be a mother of three children with rare sincerity, realism, lightness and freshness. Mostly, it just feels like we are there, we desperately want to lighten the load Marlo (Charlize) has on her hands, we are incredibly grateful for everything Tully (MacKenzie Davis - who is very far from Cameron Howe here, showing that she has great range on top of her talent) does for her. And when the film ends, it feels like what a movie is supposed to feel like: like we have journeyed somewhere else, both awed and scarred by some of what we've seen, and a little bit wiser than when we first came in.",Tully,8
True for many moms,"This movie says so much more than what is on the surface. Marlo a mother of 2, with one on the way is handling things just OK. The added stress of a newborn, a special needs kid and a darling girl tries to keep up. And true to life - things start falling apart. Her brother, with whom there is a not the greatest relationship, offers to get her a night nanny and it takes her awhile to take him up on it. And her life changes after first night of good sleep - and she and has a new friend too.
She starts being able to handle her sons needs, take care of herself and slowly you learn what is behind it all.
Many men and woman (who have not had children) do not understand the post-partum time - it is not easy all the time and with so many things on the plate of a mother with more children - it is hard.
I was not prepared for the last part - but I am sure I will be thinking of it for quite awhile. To me a good movie is one that I still think about weeks later. I loved Diablo Cody's writing - again.",Tully,8
Best film in a looong time...,"Wow, what an amazing story. Easily relatable and identifiable for any parent-how many ways do we divide ourselves to accommodate all those we love? And at what cost? But the film makers flexed some creative muscle to get this story told right. I am astonished by how moved I was when the subtle fairy tale evaporated, and reality came seeping back in to the frame. ,Being a parent is tough. It sucks everything we have out of us. But for women, as mothers, that pressure, and the demands upon that corresponding additional generosity, is factored even higher. Charlize Theron is a powerful amplifier for the message and transforms much like she did in Monster. She should prepare an Oscar acceptance speech.",Tully,10
Love it!!!,"absolutely love ""Jane The Virgin"" tonight was the first episode and Gina Rodriguez is awesome in it! She is an excellent actress and portrays ""Jane"" in a true to life and wholesome manner. The supporting cast surrounding Gina is top notch too! The show looks like it's gonna be a hit and people really need to watch this show and give the Latin community the support to show that they can be more than second class citizens in the entertainment world. I can see ""Jane The Virgin"" on the air for seasons to come . I really enjoyed how Janes grandmother had the flower in Janes hand and made her crush the flower and told her to put the flower back together and Jane said she couldn't put it back together and the grandmother said you can get your virginity back, that was great. Give this show a chance you will not be disappointed.",Jane the Virgin,10
Love it but...,"I heard so many good things about this so I started watching it on Netflix. LOVE IT! It's so funny and very well made. So... it is based on a Venezuelan soap opera, and the main characters are supposed to be from Venezuela... yes... 'supposed' because as a Venezuelan the accent play by 'abuela' it's not Venezuelan at all. Why they couldn't actually find someone to play or do a Venezuelan accent? And add more Venezuelan decor at their house? That's the thing it bothers me the most. I actually tried watching the original one and couldn't, I just don't like soap operas but this one it's amazing!",Jane the Virgin,10
A New Side of Charlize Theron,"Tully is much more than it appears to be from the outside. For those like myself who do not understand the difficulty, frustration and sometimes depression of motherhood this movie provides a very real and sometimes uncomfortable look at it. There are enough moments of comedy relief to keep your spirits lifted for most of the movie and an unexpected twist ending that ties up some of the questions you'll have throughout the movie. Charlize Theron gives a solid performance with sides of her you never thought you would see, both physically and emotionally. Overall, definitely worth the short hour and a half you dedicate to the movie.",Tully,8
A must see,Brilliant....just sayin'. Had me interested the entire movie. Wonderful characters and the story blew me away. I'm not as savvy as my friend was.,Tully,10
The Show That Proves Life is Still  Life,"I am a little biased here. I am in recovery. Sober for 20 years now. Everyday I am very grateful that I survived. I don't take my life for granted anymore. So when I herd about this show I had to watch. As soon as I was done was episode 1 I was the shows #1 fan.,Now that the show has ended its fourth season I am happy to say ""I am still it's #1 fan"". I love the fact that the show takes many chances (Some chances work some don't). I love the fact that the people in recovery are shown as human and that they still make mistakes and ""life is still life"". ,The shows first season was a little ""hit and miss"". The producers were trying to figure out what was working and what wasn't. ,What was not working on the show was Christy's work life and dating life. Her friends (and mother) in recovery was comic gold. ,In season 2 they added Jaime Pressly, Mimi Kennedy & Beth Hall. When all these women are together in one scene is when the show shines its brightest. ,Again the show is not perfect but it least it takes more chances than most television shows. It is very funny and dare I say ""Very Real"". ,To everyone that works on the show I just want to say ""Bravo"".",Mom,10
Extremely Charming!,I have only watched the first season of Jane the Virgin but I found it extremely hilarious! This show is super charming but it definitely has quite a bit of suspense. Jane is such a sweetheart and loves wholeheartedly! Her mother and grandmother truly make the show with their humor and motherly advice. Jane's relationships with Michael and Rafael get pretty complicated but they add just the right amount of drama to the show. I would recommend this show to anybody who enjoys drama and comedy! Some parts of the show are very action packed but others are full of heartfelt moments! Jane goes on a crazy roller coaster of emotions throughout the show but you'll love to watch her transformation!,Jane the Virgin,8
Entertaining and Family Love,It's very entertaining and makes you laugh but I wish there was more depth and the narration in the show gets annoying from time to time but I am obsessed with the show and can't stop watching it. I would recommend it,Jane the Virgin,9
Thank Your mom today,"Hey, forget Infinity War for one day and spend some time with Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman's movie about the real first avengers...your moms. ,Marlo is a mother of 2 with a third on the way who has a young special needs son called ""quirky"" by the school system.,He's seemingly on the autism spectrum but much like the move's handling of this mental illness and what comes later, ""Tully"" isn't exactly attuned on the specifics of mental disorders.,No, this is a movie about motherhood, a role Charlize Theron gained 50 pounds to portray accurately, so she's looking at Oscar, and right now she seems like the definite frontrunner.,Marlo seems like she's carrying 10 pounds of stress weight per every physical pound. When she lets her kids break the screen time rule, you know it's just so she can grab precious peace minutes. ,Plus there's mental toll. ""Tully"" does an awesome job of showing a woman who essentially became a sexless caregiver and is now just broken as anything else. ,She's told about night nannys, which downside is having a stranger care for your baby, but you get uninterrupted sleep without having to push a finger of whiskey in your kid's mouth so it seems like a winner. ,The nanny turns out to be Tully, played by Halt and Catch Fire's Mackenzie Davis. She's nurturing, she cleans the house, she makes you feel special, she makes you want a Tully of your own.,Yes she seems too good to be true, addressing not just the kid's issues but Marlo's as well. It leads to some funny stuff, like a sex therapy three-way. ,It's funny but but also makes you think about mom and what she's given up to do what she does, and even with a crutch like Tully, that's a whole lot.,If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",Tully,8
a comic-serious case study in post-natal psychosis,"In off-Oscar-season times, originality stands out and one of the most original you'll see this year is Tully (2018). Sure, it is full of recognisable scenes, moments, and messages that not even extraordinary acting can hide. But it is the way the narrative has been framed and the unexpected climactic reveal that leaves this film lingering in your memory long after its viewing.,We enter the story through the cliche window of a stressed-out and hugely pregnant Marlo (Charlize Theron) who is struggling to be a good mother for her eight-year old daughter and six-year old autism-spectrum son. Her useless husband Drew (Ron Livingston) expects dinner on the table each night and then retreats to his video games. Despite friend's promising that ""it gets easier each time"", the arrival of the unplanned third child becomes the tipping point for her downward spiral into a world of sleepless domestic chaos. She initially declines her wealthy brother-in-law's offer of a night nanny but on a day of multiple disasters she snaps and calls for help. Young and attractive Tullly (Mackenzie Davis) is soon on her doorstep and Marlo's world changes immediately. Tully delivers the baby for feeding, the house is clean, cakes are baked, and Marlo has a new best friend. Motherhood is a calm place until some weeks later when Tully announces she is leaving and events take unexpected turns that land Marlo in hospital. ,At one level the story feels familiar, maybe slightly fanciful, especially if you are a parent. The idea that you can be in a pit of despair and dial-in a home-delivered perfect solution is deliciously appealing. Some viewers will experience the film purely at a literal level that is comically foreshadowed in the trailer, especially the container of freshly pumped mother's milk tipping over and the cell-phone that is dropped on baby's head. Other viewers will spot the early clues but not realise until the climactic revelation that this film is a serious case study in post-natal psychosis. ,Combining magical realism, comedic drama, and a little understood mental condition into an entertaining movie is brave and original cinema. Releasing it in time for Mother's Day is almost mischievously deceptive. Charlize Theron gives an award-worthy performance that is a long way from comedy or fantasy: her portrait of a mother on and beyond the edge of sanity is grounded in the gritty daily grind of being a parent. ,There needs to be more films like Tully. While it is entertaining and even formative for some audiences to swoon over super-heroines and other fantasy females, those celluloid icons shed little light on how to live in the real world. Despite the controversy stirred up among motherhood and psychiatric fraternities, Tully can help improve understanding of post-natal mental health.",Tully,9
Allison Janney is a genius,"Allison Janney made me do something I had never done before. To be devotedly attached to a sit-com. She has created a character in Mom that it's bloody irresistible. An awful mother that it's impossible not to love. That's only achievable if the actress playing her is a genius. Anna Faris playing her daughter is a total find for me. Wonderful and a perfect foil for Allison Janney who reminds me of some of my favorites from the past, Kay Kendall, Eve Arden, Mary Astor, Joyce Grenfell and at the same time, she's like nobody else. She had only one moment in Primary Colors but she's memorable and has an entrance in The Hours that took my breath away. I want to see her in a movie that showcases her extraordinary talents to the fullest. Is that too much to ask?",Mom,10
Big LOL- is it what we are still watching in 2015? I must be on an other planet,"i really can't understand people watching soap opera, must have nothing else to do! And seriously where is there any humor in the show?! Ridiculous writing and plot lines... she is a virgin and she is pregnant with a man she once kissed! Aw no! and the doctor is a lesbian and has an adventure with her father's wife, so hot! Of course let's put some lesbian act, that's the tendency right ? It would touch a larger public... It just sends the idea that even if the wife might be lesbian she's still having sex with a man because she's so bad and has an agenda of course ;) I watched it because I discovered Bridget Regan was playing in it but how sad I felt to see her in that role, wasting her talent?! It touches a very specific kind of public and if it's what pleases the majority of us, then it is scary. This show has nothing positive to bring us, moving on...",Jane the Virgin,1
"Jane the arrogant, selfish, opportunistic virgin","Now i really did enjoy this show. I loved the culture of the Latino household and relationships between parent and child, grandparent and grandchild. The fun add ons from the narrator makes the show even more humorous than it already is. All the characters however imperfect are endearing except for the title character Ms. Jane Gloriana Villanueva. With every episode she gets more painful to watch. The actress playing Jane does a terrible job by portraying a supposedly devout godfearing good human being as an aggressive, selfish overbearing personality and has driven me and my friends to stop watching one of our previously favorite TV shows. So previously an 8.5, I now give it a 5 and will never watch this show again.",Jane the Virgin,5
Only relatives would rate this highly!,"I have tried so hard to like this show but find it impossible! I am totally convinced that the only people who have rated this show well are relatives of the cast! ,The script is just awful and just not funny! Jane seems to be pregnant forever and I guess she will be pregnant for the duration of the show! The lead actress is unattractive and not appealing! ,So basically, the script, cast and story line is pathetic and a total waste of valuable TV time!,I like the idea of multi cultural program's, which seem to be popular at the moment but creating a cross between a telenovela and American comedy isn't working just yet! ,Please stop making these awful program's!",Jane the Virgin,1
A very big small movie.,"Theron plays an overwhelmed, pregnant, middle-aged mother with a bright little daughter and an (unspoken) autistic son. She is married to a nice guy who is more into video games than being a husband. When her third is born, the endless exhaustion drives her to the breaking point. ,In comes Tully, a night nanny. She is everything Theron needs and then some. Tully becomes a counselor, night manager, best friend, and caregiver. She is a godsend to an overworked and over-stressed mother.,But Tully doesn't exist. She is the product of Theron's psychotic break. However, in this film she isn't like any of Ebeneezer Scrooge's ghosts. She has more depth and a deep secret not revealed until nearly the end.,The movie reminded me of Silver Linings Playbook in that while SLP did an excellent job of portraying the detached-from-reality life of a sufferer of bipolar disorder, Tully gives us the full-blown fantasy that can be a severe psychotic break. In both movies, the main character cannot separate reality from their own fiction. And both movies give you satisfying endings.,As a psychology instructor, I came away really liking this film for its fair portrayal of a person in crisis whose mind creates a living solution to her most pressing problems.,My wife, a nurse of 38 years and a mother of two, also liked it.",Tully,10
Heal thy self,"In ""Tully"" on the quiet night sitting together in the kitchen, exhausted suffering Mom Marlo, played by Charlize Theron, enlightens her radiant young night nanny Tully, played by Mackenzie Davis, ""We (women) don't heal."" In Diablo Cody's whimsical punchline Marlo says, ""We just wear a great concealer..."" Theron plays Marlo, the emotionally overwhelmed Mother of 2 children and newborn. ,Theron is authentically fearless and vulnerable as her Marlo loses her own identity in the everyday drudge of driving her kids to school or breastfeeding in the wee hours of the night. Her husband Drew, played by earnest Ron Livingston, is often away on extended business travel. When he is home, he's in bed playing video games on-line. That is Marlo's life. ,In Director Jason Reitman and Writer Diablo Cody's narrative Marlo experiences nearly insurmountable desperation, perhaps even depression. Yet, ""Tully"" tells its inspired story of healing oneself. Charlize Theron is bold and naked in her humanity. Her Marlo discovers salvation in the life-wise 26-year-old night nanny Tully. Mackenzie Davis is lulling gravitas as Tully, who touchingly tells Marlo, ""I'm here to take care of you."" ,Although, the narrative reveal nearly derails its noble intentions ""Tully"" creates that space in which we can all grant forgiveness, especially for ourselves. Marlo tears up when her troubled son Jonah, played by innocent Asher Miles Fallica says, ""I love you."" Theron's noble grace delivers the poignant message of acceptance that heals. ,I watched an interview with Charlize on ""Good Morning America"" talking about her role in ""Tully"". She is the mother of two adopted young children. Charlize said, ""Mothers are fearless."" Yes, Mothers give us hope for the greater. I thank and love my Mom for everything she did. Yes, Mothers are fearless. Mothers make us brave, as well. Thank you to all Moms.",Tully,8
This show is so funny!,I have to say first off I have always loved Anna Farris from the scary movie series and she does not disappoint in this sitcom at all. All these people saying that this show is negative and trashy are the same people that love two and a half men and watch it faithfully. I have laughed through every episode so far and can't wait to see how the whole series turns out. The woman who plays Anna Farris's mom is so funny and it kind of reminds you of the mother on two and half men. Don't listen to what other people say and watch for yourself before you make a judgment call. I see other shows that have a good rating like we're the millers which has no laughs in it whatsoever. We live in a generation where people see one thing they don't like an all of sudden everything about the show is bad.,Mom,10
Absolutely fantastic,"I LOVE this show. A 7 rating overall is far too low for this great show. First of all, the gorgeous Allison Janney is BRILLIANT as Bonnie. She really never fails to make me laugh. Her character is so lovably messed up. ,Secondly, this is one of my favorite role of Anna Farris's. I really like Anna Farris, but some of the roles she's done have missed the mark with me. In this show, I feel like Farris's acting style has really matured. She finds a good balance between the lovable, relatable lead and the goofball comic. ,Thirdly, the chemistry between the two of them is really where it's at. Their mother-daughter relationship is hilarious and charming. It's also very relatable, at least for those of us who maybe didn't have picture perfect childhoods or families. ,Fourthly, (yes, fourthly), the writing really is fantastic. The writers manage to address very real emotional issues with tenderness and wit. I really just can't praise it enough. ,This show genuinely is fantastic, and I hope they win lots more Emmys! They deserve it!",Mom,10
"Clever, funny and smart!","It's not easy to make a story of a dysfunctional family truly funny without making the characters dumb and ""over-the-top,"" but this show not only succeeds, it has gone through two seasons so far without losing any of its quality. It's a bit racy in spots but never gets crude (like 2-1/2 Men) or cheerfully dumb (Big Bang Theory and most other sitcoms), but even mixes in some pathos without affecting the basic humor. I haven't seen that ability since ""Frasier"". The cast, led by Anna Faris and Allison Janney, is uniformly excellent, with only French Stewart's chef being a bit too much of a caricature. Here's hoping the coming third season continues its excellent beginning.",Mom,10
Great ... start.  Generic finish.,"The Good: This show started out really well, from my standpoint. A little bit corny, a bit campy, but it didn't shy away from it. In fact, it embraced the fact that the dad Rogelio is a telenovela star. I loved the fact that it mixes with the unique blend that is Florida...a bit English, a bit Mexican, and a bit Cuban. The romance is in the air, and the language flows naturally between English and Spanish, with subtitles that allow you to carry the conversation. (I also love that every once in a while they DON'T provide the subtitles where it isn't essential. It makes me want to learn Spanish, and I don't live anywhere close to the Mexican border!) The plot follows the growing relationship between Rafael and Jane, and I wanted them to find their way together!,The Bad: About Ep. 16, I started to get a bad taste in my mouth. Jane suddenly can't keep away from Michael, (who is suddenly a good guy again) Rafael starts to close up and act like an idiot for no apparent reason, and I started to curl my nose up as I saw where it was going. Rather than stay original, the show is becoming yet another generic love triangle. And here I had such high hopes for original entertainment for the show, for the growth between Jane and Rafael and how they were going to try and manage the pitfalls of real life. But the way it is going right now, it's just another generic telenovela (soap opera). Anyone know anything else new, original and a bit romantic? I think I'm going to need to find a new show to watch. :P",Jane the Virgin,6
Incredibly Misleading Promotion,"This is NOT a comedy. It is a depressing depiction of immediate post-birth motherhood. Performances are excellent, especially Theron's. Not recommended except to those who want a drama.",Tully,6
Makes me laugh throughout the entire episode!!!,"I absolutely LOVE this show! The actors and actresses do a wonderful job at keeping you laughing! I admit, the first 2 episodes were slow on the laughs, but as the story progresses, it gets funnier and funnier. I recommend this show to anyone who loved Two and Half Men and love to laugh. Both Ana Faris and Allison Janney have great chemistry and it works for this show! They are easy to relate to. Being a single mom of a teen and a boy growing up, while working hard to pay the bills and turn around your life whilst having a crazy mom in the mix! The actors who play the teen and kid also do a great job. All in all the whole show is good. You have cameos that come in. Who doesn't miss French Stewart? He is in this show and he makes for even more laughs! All in all, this show is great and if you are looking for some laughs and see the awesome chemistry with everyone on this show, then this is the one for you!",Mom,9
Touching!,"It's not just a comedy, it bears so much grief and pain as well as many great funny stories.,It gives hope to anyone who have doubts about their life.,Every episodes is well written. Especially the first episode. ,The 22nd episode is the most touching one!,The cast is brilliant! Faris, Janny and Calveno are talented actresses. Even Rothenthal is funny and adorable.,This is a one of a kind TV show for people who truly understand what life is about and brave enough to appreciate it everyday.,Keep up the good work, Chuck!",Mom,10
Two and a Half Women,"OK so it's not what you want you children to model themselves after but then neither was producer Chuck Lorre's Two and a Half Men. This is sort of the female version of that great show and maybe it's because it's a mostly female cast that it seems to raise the ire of so many. I don't know or care, to me its funny. Anna Faris is well Anna Faris and if you like her in things like the ""Scary Movie"" series then you will probably like her playing Christy who often innocently deadpans her way through raunchy or absurd situations with great comedic sensibility. Allison Janney plays Christy's Mom Bonnie who is the counterpart to Charley Harper's slutty mom Evelyn. The show probably could use a ""Berta"" but it has enough good characters to develop into the same sort of comedic juggernaut Two and a Half Men was, given some good writing. Time will tell.",Mom,8
We all need a little help.,"Tully is a sweet, very real story about a little wish-fulfillment brought back down to earth in the best way possible. In what is probably Charlize Theron's best work yet, she shows us what we all know about life: it's hard, annoying, stressful, and we hate it - but within what is real and what is perceived, within what we love and enjoy, within our friends and family, and within ourselves, we can find power to keep going and make it better. This movie is a lesson teaching us that sometimes, we all need a little help, even if all we can do is help ourselves.
Times cried: 1",Tully,10
Genuine,"I highly recommend trying out the tactic of not knowing anything going into a film and seeing everything play out on screen freshly. I did just that with Tully, and it was quite the refreshing experience. Directed by Jason Reitman and starring Charlize Theron, Tully is a uniquely genuine film about the tremendous amount of hardships a mother goes through on a day to day basis, all while making it look easy for the rest of us. It will be a controversial one for sure, because of a few specific directions the film takes (bold ones I may add), but ultimately it succeeds in the hands of Reitman and Theron, who truly add a high level of honesty to a project that needs an audience to feel the humanity in Theron's Marlo. In short, Tully may be one of those great summer films that ends up getting forgot about come Oscar time, a la The Big Sick.,8.2/10",Tully,8
Good First Episode,"""Mom"" is a refreshing, in-your-face comedy with so many laughs you don't get much chance to settle down. For many people it will be too crude, but for those who don't mind the raunchier side of TV, this one is just fine (and never as crude as ""Two and a Half Man"" has become). Multiple Emmy winner (""West Wing"") Alison Janney plays the mom to cute as a button Anna Faris (""Scary Movie"") who in turn is the mom to relative newcomer Sadie Calvano. They all share problems with addiction and sexual appetites which make for lots of jokes as well as some touching emotional moments. ,Rounding out the cast is a riotous French Stewart (""3rd Rock"") as a chef, Nathan Corddry (""Harry's Law"") as a philandering restaurant manager, and Matt Jones (""Breaking Bad"") as Faris' out of work ex.,The creators include Eddie Gorodetsky and Chuck Lorre who gave us, among other things, ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""Two and a Half Men"",It's too early to tell if they can keep up the momentum, but the first episode certainly earns them a second look from me.",Mom,7
The show deserves a 2nd season,"I get very angry when people call this trashy. These people are normal! They are not living in a trailer selling meth! ,The show also does not glorify ""Teen Pregnancy"". If you watch the show the mother knows she made mistakes. I love the fact she loved her daughter even more when her daughter needed her the most. She did not make her daughter feel shame! She did not like the fact her daughter was pregnant but she knows there is nothing she can do about it! The teen made a mistake. Her mother still loves her and that is an AWESOME MESSAGE. This is after all not the 1950's. ,As a person in AA I find the AA aspect of the show very funny. The cast is able to bring out the best in the material.,Since this is a first year show the producers are still figuring out the voice of the show. Now there is 3 aspects if the show. Christy (the main character),1)Her home life/relationship with her mother. She also happens to have a pregnant teen. Not to mention her dating life.,2) Her work life (She once dated her married boss) ,3) AA Life,Now I suggest to the producers they focus on Christy and her relationship with her mother. Also there is plenty of millage they can get out of AA and the Marjorie character (An AA MEMBER),The work life seems forced and its usually the weakest in the laugh department.... ,Just saying",Mom,8
Tully beautifully depicts the challenges and rewards of motherhood.,"Reitman and Cody are back from their previous collaboration 'Juno' to create a simple yet visceral view on parenting and mental illness. Marlo recently gives birth to her third child and is hit with a wave of depression and sleep depravity to which she resorts into employing night nanny Tully. An incredibly basic story that will hardly start a new wave of dramas about pregnancy and motherhood, yet that's part of the alluring charm. The understated plot and the way Reitman executes the narrative just felt fresh, as if watching a cinematic piece of innovation. For him to use Cody's humorous screenplay that eloquently balances wit with philosophical tendencies and then blend it with his personalised directing style was yet another success. The screenplay enables us to emotionally connect with Marlo as a struggling mother who's pride enabled sleep depravity to sneak in and take control of her. Obtaining Theron to be the lead actress was of paramount importance. She. Is. Just. So. Good. I can't quite put into words how phenomenal she is in this. The frustration of parenting, the internal combat of staying awake and the joyous moments of glee, she portrayed every emotion like the majestic acting Goddess that she is. The combination of both the lead performance and the script resulted in a heartwarming illustration of what, I'm sure, most mothers go through. I could feel Marlo's fatigue wearing her down like a child licking an ice lolly, I could sense the inner torment of wanting to just lie down and give up. But as Reitman conveys towards its conclusion, the challenges that arise are met with the rewarding possibilities of caring for another soul. Your own flesh and blood. Your child. The inclusion of Tully in Marlo's current hectic life gave off a sense of relief, a moment to breathe amidst the chaos. The bond between these two characters was exceptional and certainly inserted various laugh out loud scenes. It is a short runtime, and so I felt the pace was a tad too quick and rushed. However, this is Reitman's best work by far.",Tully,9
More than it seems!,"A heartwarming movie about a struggling mother of two, who is also pregnant with her third child. The boy is ""quirky"" and needs special attention which doesn't make matter easier. When the third baby is born it gets even harder for her. Luckily much needed help arrives in the form of Tully, seemingly a young hip version of Mary Poppins, who helps her with the kids and also to find herself again. The movie is funny, weird and moving. Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davies are both good in it. Glad I saw it and would definitely recommend!",Tully,8
Inappropriate Hilarity (spoilers),"I love shows that tell it like it is. Shows that don't sugarcoat awful situations, and that do it with unique style. This show pushes the envelope in family dysfunction. It's two steps further into the abyss than The Simpsons or Married With Children.,As much as people don't want to admit, we do turn out like our parents. Unfortunately this is a family of alcoholic, drug addict, sluts. Christy's (Faris)daughter Violet is keeping the family tradition alive by getting pregnant while still in high school. Christy who is trying to survive and stay sober has strained relationships with both Violet and her own mother Bonnie (Janney). Christy is a punching bag for both. The one-liners keep coming episode to episode, with punches so hard that you want to give Christy a drink and tell her to forget them. But, Christy can give as good as she takes. While not mean spirited, she's told Violet that having her ruined her life. It's hard to fathom, but hilarious to hear.,This is a show that's not for the delicate or faint of heart. It's raw on every level. There's adultery, sexual harassment, terrible parenting, teen pregnancy, and just about anything else that not's suitable for immature audiences. But, if you watch it for entertainment value and not for life lessons you'll be hooked at how hilarious this show is. Sometimes you're laughing so hard you miss a joke or two.,Great performances by all. Janney is a true stand out, she's nuts and spot on in her delivery and actions.,I hope this show makes it a few seasons, it's worth it.",Mom,10
Pilot Episode,"Mom depicts with humor a real-life single mother trying to survive in this 21st century social climate. The characters are believable and the situations are real. I found myself laughing out loud any number of times during the show. Anna Faris does a fine job of depicting Christy,a single-mom recovering from an addiction problem with two kids from different guys. Christy's mom Bonnie (Alison Janney) does and excellent job of portraying the typical 2013 cougar who lives for her own self-gratification and seem perfectly fine with having been a terrible mother. I hope with all sincerity that Mom gets picked-up by the network. Good luck Mom!",Mom,9
Not a comedy,"I'm mystified how this could be considered a comedy even in the broadest sense. There is nothing remotely funny here. Heavy, depressing, and oppressive. Charlize Theron said she gained 50 pounds for the role. I left this movie feeling about that same amount of weight on my shoulders. There's a good reason why viewers' ratings are so much lower than the critics' for this one. Do not expect any laughs, or even anything remotely funny. This is a stark glimpse into the harsh realities of motherhood.",Tully,5
Strange and Unexpected,"My reaction to this movie was similar to my reaction to the trailer: I walked away confused as to what it was all about. As a fan of Juno, I was looking forward to a light-hearted comedy on the surface with just the right amount of emotional depth. Instead I was treated to an hour and a half of a zombified Charlize Theron (completely failing to convince me of her motherhood status) meandering her way through a landscape of disorienting tone shifts and half-explored plot lines, peppered with forced jokes and blatant exposition that further detracted from the already mediocre experience. At first, it seemed to be a peek into the daily life of a mother, with a heartwarming note about ditching pride and accepting help. The second half, however, descended through a series of strange scenes to an utterly bizarre finale. Any worthwhile messages intended by the creators were lost amidst the jumble of plot elements, lifeless acting, and lack of chemistry and believability in each of the relationships (Marlo and Tully, Marlo and her husband, Marlo and her kids). Overall, it just failed to come together into anything solid.",Tully,5
love this show!,"Oh my god this show has me laughing in so many ways. people talk bad about the first episode. It is like any show and you are just getting to know the characters. The content is a serious matter and is brought to light in a most hilarious way. After that it takes off like fire. Fantastic writing, clever funny lines and a great connection. I love the characters. I hardly ever laugh out loud while watching TV. I have had plenty of truly great laughs. People shouldn't be judging a show because they don't the matter of talking about teenage pregnancy, or alcoholism. Its great to see these topics discussed in a open way. A funny one. But at the same time these topics are taken seriously.",Mom,9
Love it,"I do not really understand how people do not appreciate this show. They are completely missing out on the plot. It talks about real life problems with some humour. It does not advocates any kind of lifestyle but just how people deal with those problems. There are not a lot of shows that talk about those topics and it is done really well. ,The acting is really good compared to other shows out there, it's better than two and a half man. ,I could not stop laughing during the E and hearty breakfast and the zombies and Cobb Salad made me laugh but it was touching at the same time. ,I would recommend watching at least 6-7 episodes, you will understand the characters better.",Mom,10
+++SPOILERS!*** So very disappointing!,"On the pro side we have a beautifully nuanced performance by Charlize Theron as the stressed out mom who, though near breaking point, receives next to no help or support from her clueless husband. He'd rather pay violent video games in bed at night than relate in any way to his exhausted, overworked wife. Heaven forbid he should take any interest in her day, the lives of his children or his wife's needs. Put down that joystick, fool, and give her a back rub! ,I found myself seriously bored throughout this film, so much so that I felt annoyed. I went to see it because a member of my family is in it, but as a mother myself I felt I could probably relate to it and might find it entertaining. The scriptwriter being Diablo Cody was, I thought, a plus. Yes, there are a few mildly amusing lines, a few somewhat charming moments. However, painfully not enough to hold my interest.,Tully herself was too forward for my liking. Waltzes in, bends down to get cozy with the new baby, tells Marlo to go to bed, and Marlo does! No questions about who the heck this woman is, where she comes from, what experience she has with babies (she's impossibly young looking for being a ""baby expert""), does she have references, etc. Nothing. Marlo just drags herself off up to bed, leaving her newborn downstairs in the care of this total stranger. When her lazy husband asks about leaving baby Mia with the unknown nanny, Marlo agrees that she did and that's good enough for Dad. He's not even interested enough to drag himself away from his video game to go see for himself. Nuts, both of them.,Who this Tully is is never made clear, and some weird, disquieting things happen that don't ring true, demanding suspension of disbelief, which to me is just a filmmaking cop out. ""Oh, like that would ever happen,"" the viewer says, to which the filmmaker replies: ""Just go with it! It's just a movie!"" ,And what the heck are we to make of that bizarre ending? Tully (the film) takes a sudden gigantic leap into fantasy that is jarring and annoying. Was this the only way they could wrap this thing up? Throw on a Twilight Zone ending leaving the audience wondering ""What the what, now""?,I left the theatre annoyed and shaking my head. They obviously think they're clever, these particular filmmakers, but leaving your audience baffled is insulting. I give Tully a generous 5/10, mostly for Charlize Theron's acting.",Tully,5
Funny and well-conceived dramedy with Theron in top form,"TULLY (2018) *** Charlize Theron, Mackenzie Davis, Ron Livingston, Mark Duplass, Elaine Tan, Maddie Dixon-Poirer, Asher Miles Fallica. Funny and well-conceived dramedy with Theron in top form as a frazzled mother who's third birth results in having her well-meaning brother Duplass hiring a 'night nanny' (Davis in a skillful turn) to help her decompress. Diablo Cody's spot-on dialogue driven screenplay is a corker and reuniting with director Jason Reitman continues to blend the mired miserable with the life-affirming joy. While the final act is kind of a let-down it ultimately is solid in portraying the constant juggle/struggle of adulthood and parenting.",Tully,8
Refreshing,"Once in while, it is good to be reminded that we live in a male centric society. The drinking and womanizing of Charlie Harper was quite acceptable and cute. But try to make a comedy about the realities of life for the women who have been dumped by the Charlie Harpers of this world and you get comments about the values this sitcom is carrying. Isn't that a little hypocritical at best, and plainly sexist at worst? I simply love Anna Faris (I hope she reads this) This lady is talented and able to carry this show with the fabulous Allison Janey. ""Mom"" is certainly not perfect, but it has the unique quality of portraying something true. It is honest and doesn't try to be anything else. It is refreshing, and in my opinion, deserve an 8.",Mom,9
"7, if not for laugh track","What a laugh track says to me is this: it says you don't trust your own writing, actors, or show. It says you think I am stupid and wouldn't know where to laugh. It weakens your effort.,The show is fine. The acting is good, and I really enjoy seeing middle aged people in a show. I am not a great fan of family sitcoms, but this one is much better than most. I enjoyed the 12-step background.,But I cannot forgive a laugh track. When did MASH give up its laugh track? 1984? That is getting to be quite sometime ago. So TV, quit doing it. It tells me that your show is aimed at far stupider people than me. If it isn't, then trust your writers and actors.",Mom,5
Great realistic show!,"Very good show!,It is a shame to watch some negative ratings on such a series. Are people worried about teenage pregnancy, alcoholics, single moms or free sex? Well, get real, that is how real life is. ,The only thing I don't like, are the laugh tracks, but that is my problem.,The way characters have been developing is incredible.,It is very good to see that besides all the crap that may happen in our lives, it is always possible to correct ourselves. We can clearly see how Christy and Bonnie have a good and fair heart and always try to redeem themselves from mistakes (both of the past or present). Also, is lovely to see how their relationship develops, such as the relationships with their friends. They all may sound comically harsh to each others, but when something serious happens, we see them taking the right side and defending each other and that's what matters in life.,I understand there are many types of humor, but to say MOM is not good because of their topics, makes no sense. Only one who lives in a shell or denies the real life can say that. It is much more interesting to see this than another cliché storyline of some sort of normal family with a light tendency to be JUST funny. ,I personally congratulate both Anna Faris and Allison Janney. I was not a fan of them, but I am now. Besides their wonderful acting skills, they show a very humanistic mindset.,AND TO THE HATERS, SEASON 5 IS COMING. BAM.",Mom,10
"Really, Really Good... Until The Last 10 Minutes","Tully is a beautiful movie - for all but the last 10 minutes. Charlize Theron carries the movie amazingly, as always. Mackenzie Davis supports her beautifully as the titular character as well. Tully scores big for its honest portrayal of a struggling mother. It isn't afraid to go where it wants to go - and that kind of unabashed storytelling is amazing...,But then, it presents a twist that I am not sure works. My reviews are spoiler free, so I won't dive into it, but I'm not convinced this was always the working ending. I think they could have concluded the movie in a different way that would allow the tale to become a classic. This way, it's a see-it-once and never again kind of movie, in my opinion.,Definitely worth seeing, but a little too shocking for its own good.",Tully,8
Not quite what you think. Much more than you expect.,This film accomplished everything I FEEL PRETTY attempted to do.,Tully,9
Chapter 7 is a whole new level,"As a comedy, this show is not as successful as sillicon valley, and until the end of the chapter 6, this show is kind of boring. But chapter 7 makes this show really great, and you will realise many points of the previous chapters are connected in this one chapter.,The greatness of this chapter is, Barry has to kill an innocent person, Chris, which is a violation of his own moral code. He can not stand it. It seems like breaking bad, but you could see the difference very easily. And also, this episode is so informative in such short time. I watched this episode for many times, each time I could notice something new. ,Chapter 7 is true art, and this is not comedy any more.",Barry,10
Cindy Campbell and Juno's stepmother = the perfect comedy duo!,"I've loved Anna Faris since the first time i saw her in the Scary Movie franchise. She's one of the most hilarious actress, she makes those faces you cannot not laugh at. I've discovered Allison Janney in Juno and thought she was just amazing! And the chemistry of them together is really great! The jokes are well placed through the episodes, they deal with important subject and are able to treat them with comedy and tact and that is a great quality. The grand-mother/mother/daughter relationship is fantastic! The kid actors and also pretty funny. ,It might be a useless detail but the thing that bothered me were the ""In the last episode of Mom"": where they spent one entire minute remembering us what we never forgot from last week episode, it feels like a waste of time. ,Also, as much as i love Anna Faris, we can feel some stress and/or nervosity in her act, it might be because she's not use to the audience or something, but its like there is a little something missing to make it more real, i don't know what though. But she is a great actress and can deal with awkward physical comedy so well.,To sum up, great cast, good jokes, gorgeous sets and a beautiful chemistry between the main actress! 9/10",Mom,9
Chuck Lorre channels Norman Lear without the cute catch phrases,"This show is very much like a Norman Lear show of the '70s and I don't mean that an insult.,It's a show that is not afraid to have cutting issues, while still remain funny. Unlike many shows on today, the characters face consequences that do not reset in the next episode.,Our country currently has a drug problem, so I am glad that they don't sugar-coat the characters and give them just a drinking addiction, which has been done over and over again.,Anna Faris is also very funny and talented. She can make you laugh with just a look.",Mom,9
"Very interesting, funny show, but only if you get it.","I was intrigued by the idea of a comedy show that portrays the horrors of addiction and its inevitable tragedies. As a long term survivor of the disease of alcoholism and an active participant in recovery, I began watching it to see how the show presented itself as relates to recovery. I have to say, after having watched all of the episodes so far that I find both the unfolding stories of the characters and the little slices of life at AA to be very well done. For those who say that the show is exploitative of human tragedy, I invite you to work hard, become a drug addict or alcoholic and come to a recovery program to see just how close to reality this show really is. In my time in recovery I have seen countless situations that were just as ridiculous and tragic as this one turn around and become stories of human triumph over adversity. One of the great joys of recovery is to be able to look back at the crazy things that happened in our lives and laugh because they are long gone and have been replaced by sanity. In my experience, early sobriety is often just as crazy as is presented here. I have never had anyone pull up to my house drunk in a fire truck as happened in the latest episode, but I have to say, if it did occur, I wouldn't be very surprised. Drunks are an imaginative lot and prone to bad decisions. People under the influence, both of substances and of substance abusers can do some very stupid things If you can't relate to the humor in this show, I understand. I probably couldn't either if I hadn't seen it played out over and over for years. Far too often, it ends tragically, but the joy that comes when it ends in triumph is wonderfully fulfilling. I have been so fortunate to have seen a good number of people come through things at least as crazy as this show and lead great lives, and then be able to look back and laugh at the folly that was their life under the yoke of addiction. I can't wait to see what happens to Christy and her mom! 9 Stars.",Mom,9
Deserves the praise Juno received,"I knew going into this film that I would love it simply from being able to relate to it. I have a six month old baby and mine too was unplanned. Watching this movie was like looking at a montage of the first few months of being a mom. You're exhausted all the time and like her I was the one doing all the late nights while my husband got to sleep. Sometimes you become so tired you feel as if you're an outsider to your own life and I think this film did a perfect version of expressing that feeling while also expressing the fact that when you become a wife and a mother you're so busy focusing on everyone else you begin to lose pieces of who you were. Without giving away the twist I can say I loved the meaning behind it. The older you get and the more you put others ahead of yourself the more you become a different person and who you were when you were younger seems almost like it didn't happen. It becomes harder to recognize and remember the younger version of yourself because it seems like (and in some ways it was) another life. This film meant so much to me as a mother just starting out because it felt so reassuring to know other women are going through the same experiences particularly never feeling like you're doing well by your kids even though you try so hard every single day. You look at other mothers and think ""now there's the perfect mother"" when in reality every mother has to go through that phase of life after giving birth when your body is different and you don't feel as attractive and you have to deal with how that affects your marriage and self image. It's just a fantastic film that doesn't try too hard to be it just is. It just is. This is what it's like to be a mother and I've heard some people in reviews say the movie was boring well guess what? That's what makes it real. Real motherhood is not a Real Housewives episode. This is real.",Tully,10
Required watching for new dads,"Sure, new dads read What to Expect, but this movie gave a realistic entry into the mind and sheer exhaustion a new mother experiences. Pay close attention to her- post partum depression is real and can be serious.",Tully,8
As Charming And Fun As I Imagined,"Right from the get go I knew this would be a gem, from the trailers to the clips, there was something unique and charming about it. Happily I was not disappointing as the show now has my full attention and I really liked it, looks like another HBO. So you know the premise, killer gets dragged into an acting class, finds out he loves it even though he sucks, now he wants to balance killing with his new found passion. But without giving anything away, there is more to the story than just that. The writing was as witty and charismatic as I expected, kind of reminded me of Dexter. The producers are known for some pretty big shows like Seinfeld, Silicon Valley, and of course Bill Hader himself. So its no surprise we have another fun little show on our hands.,Bill Hader's performance is just as unexpectedly good as everything else in this show, his character is very intriguing, unique, and fun to watch. Same goes for all the other actors like Stephen Root and Sarah Goldberg, such a great chemistry everyone has makes for a good show so far. I'm fully invested in the show and very much look forward to seeing the entire thing. The story clearly has many directions to go in and I can't wait to see what was created.",Barry,8
Anna and Alison shine!,"I honestly started watching this show because I am a huge fan of Anna Faris, I have loved her in everything she's been in! She is hilarious and absolutely one of my favorite actresses. That being said, I actually wasn't expecting to like this show at all, but boy was I wrong! I'm hooked! I think it's hilarious! Anna and Alison, who plays her mother, absolutely shine together! Alison is a phenomenal actresses, I love how she says what's on her mind! Yes, sometimes I can see how some comments on the show could be offensive... but isn't every show like that!? Life is like that! You're not going to like everything. I think it's unfair to say this is a terrible show unless you go in open-minded & really give it a shot! It's a winner in my book!!!",Mom,10
Furious with Last Pregnancy Episode,"Really? You really had a sappy, totally unrealistic stupid show glorifying teenage pregnancy, with the Mom and grandmother happily supporting this moronic situation? Don't you understand how much damage you did, and that now some stupid, immature teenage girls who already are playing with this fantasy with their equally stupid boyfriends just got another green light to delude themselves into believing, ""Aww, how cute I'll be pregnant and my boyfriend will be all happy and supportive, as will my mom, and we'll just trip on down the road of life and live happily ever after..""blah blah blah! I kept waiting and hoping that the pregnancy test would be negative and that the girl would get a wake up call to at least use birth control. But no...not a word about that. What a terrible disservice you did to teenage girls! The only HONEST show about teen pregnancy is ""Teen Mom"", which shows the reality of boyfriends who bail, girls who have to give up everything for that baby they had so much fun making, the mothers of the teen moms who are usually single as well having to step in and give up their own lives because of the selfish decisions their daughters made, the poverty and struggles, abuse by the boyfriends, constant stress, depression and misery, lack of education so bettering themselves is next to impossible....That's the reality! Not this moronic garbage in this particular Mom episode! Honestly, shame on you for such a stupid, thoughtless episode!",Mom,1
Ignore the laughter track and its very despressing,"The main actress is a great female comedian. In all her works so far, she never needed a laughter track to make us laugh. But for this show, she needed it.,The story-lines are so, so, so depressing. Teenage pregnancy, selling and taking drugs, adultery, underage sex, not paying child support, beating a hooker to death, living in a van, taking a child to a strip club, cutting of your finger. And this was all in the first episode! Without the laughter track, you would think you were watching a deadly serious HBO Drama. There are no puns, no jokes, no one-liners. Its depressing watching the worst society has to offer and a laughter track making us think that its okay to laugh at a wasted life.,Cancel this show. Please. Just cancel it.",Mom,1
Very promising,"Let me say it fast and simple 
Im really looking forward to see this show to grow.,Very funny and Bill Hader acting is just A+",Barry,8
"Barry Is A Hit, Man.",I felt like I was watching Bill Hader win an Emmy in real time. Absolutely loved it!,Barry,9
Horrendous,"I would like to start by saying I hate pretty much anything Chuck Lorre has his grubby little paws in, but this show has taken it to a new level of bad. Quite literally every show Chuck Lorre ""creates"" is exactly the same but in a slightly different setting, the jokes are literally the same just twisted to suit the premise. ,The canned laughter, the crappy script, poor acting and general theme make this one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Anna Faris being the only shinning light in the 22 minute horror show that is Mom, how they even persuaded her into this is beyond me. ,I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled after Mom. I truly hope you heed my advice and steer very well clear of this nightmare.",Mom,
First episode disappointing,"We really wanted to like this. Well-known and well-like actors, good reviews, etc. Started cringing from the first scene. Topics were simply too serious to be funny. Multi-generational sluts, teen pregnancies, adultery, drug and alcohol use, drug sales, (at least they threw in AA), absent and deadbeat dads..... Hey I can watch the news for this plot. About half way through we voted to delete the scheduled recordings. I'm trying to think back to see if I actually laughed during the show. No, I don't remember doing so. We did keep pointing out the various actors and what shows we knew them from. So sad that there is so much comic talent here going to waste.",Mom,2
Watched it. Liked it.,"There are a lot of series to choose from on TV now and quantity often lowers quality. This series seems fresh, intelligent all in its first 30 minutes. Watched it twice. Looking forward to next episode.",Barry,10
Cool,"So far so good. Excuse my grammar... ,This show is already off to a good start with the balancing act of cinema. Not too over the top and has a few surprises every now and then. It is genuinely funny and not in a contrived way. The first thing I look for in a show is how they start it. I believe that if you're gonna do something that you better do it right or don't come at all. The movement and placement of the camera made the show official in my eyes because it's one of the things that I look for in terms of ""will this be good"". The story and acting is pretty good. The main character is great and portrays what the show is about.",Barry,8
Barry's dream life as an actor,"Another great HBO series, love it. Barry is such a relate-able character with a great support cast I'm hooked. This is dark comedy at its best as Barry and minder get deeper and deeper into trouble i cant wait to see how he maneuvers his way to his dream life as an actor.",Barry,10
Premise hooked me in but very disappointed with the result,"I loved the premise of this series. It's not entirely original but I was hopeful that amidst all of the absolute drivel that is premiering lately that this would be a series that I could engage with,
No. I'm not seeing what the other reviewers are seeing. Aside from Henry Winkler, who was cast beautifully in his role as an acting coach, I found it to be incredibly dull.",Barry,4
Barry Kills!,"Having just finished Chapter 7, and realizing that I have to wait for the finale just like the rest of you, I decided to give a reason as to why you should be watching. The film major in me sees the inevitable gold mine of information that this show is. Berg and Hader have began crafting an amazing world with this show. There isn't a single character that feels out of place. Barry has this incredibly relatable motivation of 'What am I doing with my life?"" Yet it is portrayed in a way that pulls you away from the dogged question in reality. Barry is the epitome of dark comedy, you'll laugh hard with one breath and gut wrench in the next. There is no action that does not have a consequence, the conflicts that arise only resolve in more conflict. The actors acting as actors learning to act is sublime. I could go for days about why Barry is a new staple for HBO, but I suggest you watch it and see for yourself. If you're studying film/script-writing/acting you need to add this to your watch list, it's a goldmine of skills.",Barry,9
Those Chechens!,"I agree with everything good said about this black comedy and can only emphatically add that the Chechen gang is exquisitely crafted and hilarious. Perhaps the most extraordinary character, the bald Noho (""Can I get you a submarine sandwich?""), is unforgettable. Just a brilliant performance. The ridiculous twins, one who is obsessed with killing Barry and then his tortuous brother who insists on building a set of stocks, are wonderfully absurd.",Barry,10
Barry's Veteran Status is Relatable,Shorty after I got out of the Marine Corps it took some time to find my place in the civilian world. I think this show does a good job of illustrating that period in veteran's life in a darkly comedic way.,Barry,8
No compelling motivations,"Heres an unbelievable story, so it cannot engage its audience, except on the most shallow levels.
There are no compelling motivations oferred for any of the characters to do what they do.
Barry is supposedly seduced into a drama group by what? He can't act, he shows no sign of being able to in the future. The familiar face of Henry Winkler hides a character that seems to be a fraud, with only his charisma/bravado to offer....quite suitable really for so-called drama students who onky know or care about Hollywood tinsel rather than real theatre.
We are supposed to believe that Barry is depressed as the banality of his killing job and wants to spice up his life by going for auditions for bit parts in TV commercials..........oh please, this is shallow rubbish, filled with flimsy wanna-be's. Bill Hader has undeniable screen presence but needs something better than this as a vehicle.",Barry,3
Intriguing,"Absolutely so... this is a show that will be something I'm sure I could not wait until the next week for, and so I wait!",Barry,10
A different life and different style to live a choice between acting or killing!,"This latest ""HBO"" series called ""Barry"" is a nice blend of comedy and drama which entertains never bringing a dull episode and you as the viewer will become hooked! Even though the plot is a little far out each episode is a journey of choice and fate.,Comic Bill Hader is ""Barry"" a Midwest man who's life centers around being a hit man and killing as he even does jobs for the mob! So when a job takes him out west to L.A. things occur and his life takes a spin that it lands him in an acting class! And you guessed it ""Barry"" has caught the showbiz fever!,Each episode he feels conflicted between each way of life as he's tied between killing and acting. Along the way ""Barry"" meets young and want to be star of anything with a cast and that's Sally(Sarah Goldberg) who takes a liking to ""Barry"" and the sparks and flames of love also fly between them! Also in a good supporting turn is the work from veteran Henry Winkler as a tough and direct acting class coach. Overall well done series that's entertaining by blending comedy and drama watch it I give it thumbs up!",Barry,9
"watchable, but not at the level of Get Shorty the series","Hard not to compare the two show.
the black humor not as well developed or written.
the killer character that wanna do something else in L.A. is not as believable or charismatic as Chris O'Dowd one in Get Shorty.
Same with all the other actors, not as compelling .
i guess get shorty benefited of higher production $, better scenes, better scripts. will see how season go, cross fingers it get better as writing and characters go.",Barry,6
Worse written than it deserves,"Tragic. Great casting, pretty good premise, and horrible, horrible writing. Not dialogue, mind you, just the plot. I have no idea how this can have 98% on RT.
The whole plot is lining up ex machinas and then ticking them off. Characters often do that thing where suddenly, for five minutes they're someone totally different so we can get some juicy 'conflict' and I honestly don't get why. Is it really that hard to have problems arise organically with a cast that includes a hit-man, gangsters, law enforcement, uncle/agent figure and about 30 obliviously failing actors?,That being said, if you love terrible writing, fake people and are crazy about acting lessons, this is for you!",Barry,2
Wildly Disappointing,This show is not funny. I chuckled maybe three times.I can't see this show getting a second season.This makes Documentary Now! look like slapstick. Don't waste your time.,Barry,
Leon:The Profesional serialized,"It looks like the writers or producers had a great idea , lets do a TV series based on a great movie. How about Luc Besson's Leon: The Profesional. Then they asked how much for the rights to Leon and had another great idea, lets just steal the premise and call him Barry instead.,The lead actor reminds me of Dexter (quite a lot) , his handler reminds me of Danny Aiello in Leon, just without the charm. The rest I couldn't comment on I fell asleep and it was 10 in the morning!",Barry,1
Reminds me of early Breaking Bad,"No, I'm not saying Barry is anything like Breaking Bad in terms of quality or cultural relevance. What it is though is a great juxtaposition of two very different worlds, and Hader does a great job playing a guy who has been forced into a box he doesn't belong in, or at least doesn't want to be in. He's also another comedic actor playing a more serious role here, and while the show has only shown brief flashes, it has the potential to be something really good.,The one major mistake the creators could make though is to move more towards ""comedy"", because Barry is absolutely at it's best when it's a drama with some funny moments, like BB. Again, I'm not saying Barry is on the level of BB at all, more so it just reminds me of the potential of BB in season 1 before it became the non-stop thrill ride and tour de force it eventually became in subsequent seasons. Barry has the potential to be that on a ""junior"" level scale, but if the creators lean towards highlighting the ""comedy"" aspect as time goes on it's just gonna suck. In a perfect world this would be a 1hr show that was more drama than comedy, but even with what we have so far I'm very excited to see where this show goes next.",Barry,9
"Geeze, this is a Corageous Show (Spoilers)","I am a little breathless after the finale of season One. (spoilers to follow),The killing of Chris was...sigh, weep for both him and Barry....necessary, I suppose, but fully and complete tragic.,The death of Janice in the finale...was even more terrible. ,And yet, and yet...there is an important moral to this show, an animating premise...,Reformation, becoming a different person, rehabilitation, the putting of PTSD behind you...all of this is possible, (but seems to have been washed free from current American culture).,This is an important message of...hope. To everyone, this is also a Christian idea, (x Calvinism)....I am just so pleased that Bill Hadler is trying to teach America something new, or, trying find something we have forgotten and are deeply poorer for this loss.,But gads...this has been tough...tough love in the most extreme form...it has been a while since Television has compelled me to turn off all lights, sit myself down in front of the set and watch with open wonder at what complexity can be accomplished when creative forces are set free.,Watch this to burnish up your humanity!",Barry,10
"If you enjoy Bill Hader, then this should be right up your alley.","I haven't had a TV in years. So every so often I head to youtube to watch old episodes of stuff then come to this website to catch up on what's new out there. If I find something that catches my interest, I hunt it down till I find it on the net. For the 6 months, when I'm burned out by gaming, I have been watching old clips from the last few years of SNL (among other things). And I really enjoy the versatility and range of Bill Hader. But I had no idea of how truly broad his range was. Someone mentioned this show in the comment section so I came here to look it up then decided to hunt it down to watch. My first thought was, damn, he's pretty good in this. By the end of the second episode, I was hooked. The finale, well, when I finished I immediately went to find if it got renewed for season 2. If this man and this show don't win an Emmy, I'd be highly surprised. 
Now, keep in mind I have been in a TV drought for the last 10 years (I'm one of the working poor and had to choose between TV or internet cause I can't afford both). Therefore, I have never seen Dexter (though when I talk to my son on the phone, he keeps telling me I need to find it and watch it sometime), nor a lot of these other shows people seem to want to keep comparing it to. So the premise is fresh and new to me. Some of the dark humor might have been a shred over the top but not overtly done. The darkness is what really shines, those holy s*** moments. It took a couple of episodes to really flesh out the characters and for the cast to hit their stride with one another. Hader's (Barry) performance is magic for me along with Anthony Carrigan (NoHo Hank) and Stephen Root (Monroe Funches). Cudo's and well done!! Can't wait for the next season (darker and grittier according to Hader)!!",Barry,10
"""I'm telling you this because you're a super nice guy, Bahriy!""","As several clever blurb writers have already pointed out, there are lots of bad actors here: a bungling Chechen crime family plus the latently talented newbies in Gene Cousineau (Henry Winkler!)'s cutrate acting class, just to start with. The Chechens are mostly funnier than the actors; funniest of all is gangster/hipster NoHo Hank (Anthony Carrigan); his faux-Russian accent is a phonetic tour de force. ,Of course, the series is built around Bill Hader's sweet-natured basic-guy persona. The premise may seem a little gimmicky at first, but Hader outdoes himself as the bummed-out ex-Marine turned contract killer who finds his life's purpose in Cousineau's stripmall atelier. The part of Cousineau himself's a slam-dunk for Henry Winkler; he's a veteran bit player/acting coach who can totally talk the talk, though we only get to see him walk the walk for about ten seconds (auditioning for the part of Man at Back of Line). ,Paula Newsome does well with the more challenging role of Det. Moss, a shrewd LA cop who (somehow) can't resist Cousineau's smarmy come-ons; Sarah Goldberg draws the short straw as Barry's blond love interest, but she still gets to represent with a resonant #MeToo subplot and a gender-blind Macbeth soliloquy. (Why do the women always have to do the heavy lifting?),There have been a lot of cable shows about aspiring actors and comics lately, but what really stands out with this one is the skillful plotting and pacing. After the ""Travis Bickle meets the cast of Waiting for Guffman"" concept has had some time to settle in, the writers--including Hader and sitcom laureate Alec Berg--take the old line about tragedy being repeated as farce and spin it around. The farcical tone of the first few eps has turned pretty dark by mid-season, and video director Hiro Murai (eps 5 and 6) gets a lot of the credit there. An ingenious plot twist in the closer clears the stage for a second season, though Barry's still going to have lots of 'splainin' to do in S2:E1...",Barry,9
Casual approach to tragic violience,"Enjoyed this because of the actors in it more than the plot. Individual character development was fun but not too deep.
The scene with Stephen Root and Glen Fleshler at the dinner table was brilliant.
And I generally love anything with Henry Winkler in it.
The overarching approach to just casually gunning down people in cold blood has always bothered me about American television and film and this series doesn't bring anything new to that premise.
But I suppose one would expect this kind of lack of empathy from a tv series based on a hitman.",Barry,7
Second episode is soooo bad,"Just watched the second episode yesterday after an amazing first episode. Safe to say that the quality dropped massively from one episode to the other. I have never writtin more than 2 reviews in here ever, but I felt that I should warn people not wasting 30 minutes of their lives, you are better off watching the bachelor or something and it would still be better entertainment than this slow slow and very boring second episode.",Barry,6
"So bad, its good! So good, its not bad!","This is how comedy works. You take something cliche, you twist and turn it and what is likely to be bad becomes good. ,This show offers a cliche and mediocre story line, but the main characters/actors make up for it. The lead character is dull and uninspiring but the comedic element makes him hyper interesting. ,It is so bad that the actions of the actors do not need to be questioned. Like throwing a gun away on the street after a shooting. Other flaws and illogical acts, no need to dispute them. Which makes it good. Feel-good. ,The only problem is..... how long will this remain good?",Barry,8
"I didn't think anyone could write a decent comedy these days , I WAS WRONG","For the first time in nearly 3 years i can finally say something that's modern and in this century has made me laugh i cant get over how amazingly blunt the jokes are in the show , and that's what i think the writers went for in this film BLUNTNESS , every joke in the film hits you like a ton of bricks there isn't one scene that didn't have me in fits of laughter it was just fantastic. Jason Bateman again showing the world he can act and telling his critics to go swivel on his middle finger by how great he was in horrible bosses.,I personally rated every single actor in this film as Grade A , the acting was just superb! If you want a good laugh and a good night out go and see horrible bosses , best 8 pounds 50 I've ever spent! Oh on a side note , something totally off topic! As the film ended in the cinema i got up and went down the stairs leading out of the cinema , i looked back for my mate who was taking his time , and everyone was still sat down watching the blooper reel , when it ended everyone saw me alone at the bottom of the stairs noticed my T-SHIRT and i quote my T-SHIRT SAYS! FAT PEOPLE ARE HARD TO KIDNAP.,Entire cinema laughed! :) Great day Great Film , Great Audience.",Horrible Bosses,8
Stop the Presses! A Funny Comedy for Adults,"Those who think Hollywood is no longer capable of creating a funny comedy for adults need not worry, as ""Horrible Bosses"" is proof that that increasingly rare phenomenon can still happen.,""Horrible Bosses"" is one of those comedies like the classic ""Ruthless People,"" in which an outrageous and dark premise works because of good writing and an ensemble that knows exactly how to handle the material for maximum comedic value. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day play the requisite straight man, alpha male and dumbass, respectively, that male buddy comedies need, while Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell (sadly underused) play the titular bosses. All of them have a field day with their roles, and Aniston especially stands out because of the film's decision to cast her against type as a slutty, foul-mouthed sex kitten; you can almost hear Aniston sighing with relief as she gets to play something other than the cute-as-a-button girl next door.,As with most comedies, whether or not you think ""Horrible Bosses"" is funny will probably depend simply on whether or not you think the actors are funny. Charlie Day, for example, will likely drive some people crazy -- I thought he was hilarious.,Grade: A",Horrible Bosses,8
Hilarious all the way,"Just got back from a press screening. Horrible Bosses is an easy to relate to comedy that keeps you engaged and amused all the way. Some great scenes involving crude/sexual/racial humor that catch you off guard and have you rolling. The plot is a little forced, as was the ending, which is partially forgivable in the case of a comedy, as long as it makes you laugh. Seeing Kevin Spacey play asshole boss brought back fond memories (Swimming With Sharks), he pulls it off very well. Jennifer Aniston very outside her standard girly role, and it was awesome. Charlie Day was amazing, and resembles his character in always Sunny in Philly (personal fav). Overall, not quite for the collection, but definitely worthwhile a trip to the movie theater!",Horrible Bosses,7
"I'll take my comedy raw, blackened, with a side of crazy please.","Murder. Car chases. Scandal. Rape. Conspiracy. Blackmail. Revenge. These are usually the key words to a suspenseful drama, but in this case are applied to a dark comedy that is relentless, chaotic, and just as funny as advertised. Horrible Bosses is the type of movie that would make Danny DeVito proud, as it blends a fun plot full of fun twists with standout comedic performances, plenty of surprises, and the inability to ever become predictable. Unlike most recent R-rated comedies, this film is raunchy without truly crossing the line, profane without becoming redundant and outrageous without becoming tedious. Don't look now but this movie is legitimately funny, and among the better comedies released in quite some time.,Horrible Bosses is about three average joes (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis) that are stuck on their job with awful bosses (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Ferrell) all for different reasons. After all three reach their breaking point, they decide that their lives would be better if their bosses ceased to exist. What follows is their hilarious efforts in finding a way to get it done without getting caught. The premise was promising and thanks to a fresh script by Michael Markovitz, John Daly, and Jonathan Goldstein, the potential was indeed delivered—although not in the ways you'd expect.,The cast is hands-down the standout reason why this movie works. As a matter of fact its also its one minor flaw because we have tons of talent that were not utilized enough because some of the performances were so hilarious in the minimal material given. The bosses themselves were convincingly awful, especially the always-reliable Kevin Spacey as this sadistic, manipulative, and extremely cruel president of a company. Colin Ferrell and Jennifer Aniston step out of their usual roles and surprisingly deliver plenty of laughs with their own cruelly aggressive mannerisms. The main three also provided plenty of laughs and played off each other perfectly well, with Charlie Day being the best of the three. Day's experience with the mildly-dark ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" definitely shows off here, as his whiny and high-pitched voice perfectly matches his character persona and offers the most laughs and one-liners.,Seth Gordon's resume as director has been an interesting one; ranging from the enjoyable Fistful of Quarters to the weak-weak Four Christmases. In here, he keeps the pace constantly quick, constantly throws a crazy scenario to pit our heroes in, and never gives you a chance to breathe and realize how preposterous this movie really is. The movie's raunchiness is matched by its grim sense of humor—you need a dark strong heart to laugh at some of the mean-spirited shtick that is embedded in the 100 minute timeframe. In this movie, nobody is safe, and you never know just what might happen next. Unpredictability is essential in comedy, and the best part of Horrible Bosses is how it can remain one step ahead of you while still giving plenty to laugh about. We are laughing at our heroes but secretly we are definitely rooting for them too. Yes folks, you will secretly be hoping that they do indeed do the dirty deed.,Bottom Line: The talent pool runs deep here, and is the main reason why the film works. Luckily for us and the cast, they also got to work with great pacing, a fun script, and fresh dark humor that can inject life in this dismal summer season. The underrated talent of Sudekis, Day, and Bateman continue to quietly shine in Hollywood as they are hilarious from the first second to the closing credits. But let's not forget the triple-villain team of Aniston, Spacey, and Ferrell, which infused even more humor (and craziness) into the comedy. To sum it up, the film works in its dark manner, as Horrible Bosses never takes itself seriously, but you'll be too deep into laughter to notice the difference. The movie is dark as the movie earned its R rating easily, but if you can handle it you are in for a uproarious ride. Keep an eye on this one, as it is one of the best summer surprises in recent years.",Horrible Bosses,9
First Rate Comedy,"Lots of twists and turns in this surprising comedy. At first you'll think you know what's going to happen -- but wait, and watch the movie to the very end, including the credits. Several in this extraordinary cast (perhaps especially Jennifer Aniston) step outside their ""comfort zone"" and display aspects of their personalities and acting skills that may surprise you. I find it difficult to impossible to say which actor is ""best"" only because so many of them are extremely good. ,The ""R"" rating for this movie is for real, and is about the language in particular (when you have a character whose very name can't be mentioned in the trailers and reviews you know you're in that territory). Many qualities of this movie (including the screenplay, the directing and editing, and the superb original score) had to come together for it to be as good as it is -- and they do.",Horrible Bosses,10
Must See!,"2 words can describe Horrible Bosses and those two words are Must See! Horrible Bosses is definitively a change from those predictable comedy movies and you will get your money's worth if you go and see it.,The cast is this film is just so extraordinary it's to hard to pick one favorite. I loved Charlie Day's character in this film as he is always fun to watch. Jennifer Aniston's character was so sexy to watch that any young man would show some interest. As it was said before it was good to see her do something new and she nailed every sexy/dirty line. Another character I loved partially because he usually never does comedies was Colin Farrells as the coke head boss. He really went out did himself for it and it shows.,The script in this movie was so well done and had some really raunchy and crude things in there but it was acted and portrayed so well it made it even the more better. The dirty and sexual dialog was hilarious, it was hard not to laugh and it showed they weren't afraid to hold anything back.,This movie is a great summer flick and I highly recommend this comedy. The cast and their characters will really get you going and they might shock you a little but it will be all worth it in the end.",Horrible Bosses,10
Hilarious!,"I loved this movie! It kept me laughing through the whole movie. I loved that Colin Farrell and Jennifer Aniston both played characters outside their norm. In fact, when I first say Bobby, it took me a moment and another scene with Bobby for me to realize that it was Colin! I read that Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughy, and Ashton Kutcher were all considered for this movie and I am so glad that they weren't part of this movie. All of the actors in this film were perfect for this movie and the acting was superb! This is a movie that should be watched for the entertainment factor and when you just need a great laugh. Plus, who can't relate to having a horrible boss and dream of getting rid of them? If you enjoyed this movie with Jason Bateman, then I recommend that you watch The Switch, which he also stars in and is another greatly entertaining movie.",Horrible Bosses,10
Humorous Crimes,"Horrible Bosses is too crazy for a dark comedy. We all know killing your boss is a cruel idea but in this film they're making it a joke. Despite from its cruelness, Horrible Bosses isn't horrible at all. It's undeniably hilarious. Too much fun by the performance of the cast. Horrible Bosses doesn't have a lot of gumption to its dark premise but it's all about the comedy. This is just a little comedy that you will enjoy all the time.,The beginning of the film shows how horrible their bosses are. It's pretty reasonable why they wanted to kill them. But what's fascinating here is how the main three had a perfect chemistry to their horrible bosses. Especially when it comes to Charlie Day and Jennifer Aniston. Charlie Day made his role too innocent to get sexualized by Jennifer Aniston. He's like a child being harassed by a pedophile. Jason Bateman plays a hardworking man and Kevin Spacey is teasing him like a bully. Kevin Spacey is perfect for this role. Jason Sudeikis and Colin Farrel does their thing.,The entire film is all about the laughs and the fun. Nothing else to say about the filmmaking. The movie is just funny. It doesn't have a knack to get serious in some parts. Its darkness is always hilarious. By the way this is a comedy. It's supposed to fun all the time. Yes, like even murder is funny.,Horrible Bosses is not the kind of film that tries to be the best. It's just a little fun comedy. It's a movie that you'll still enjoy even if you've seen it many times. It's funny enough. It's clever enough. Most of the fun goes to the performances. At least Horrible Bosses is one of those better comedies that we are getting recently. It's just fun.",Horrible Bosses,7
Horrible Bosses Is Easily The Best Comedy Of The Year!,"There have already been two major comedy releases this summer, in the form of The Hangover Part 2 and Bridesmaids, but Horrible Bosses puts both of those to shame. With ease.,Director Seth Gordon (The King of Kong) has put together an absolutely fantastic dark comedy, full of hilarious dialog, raunchy humor, and an exceptionally strong cast. The real treat of the film, much like 2009's The Hangover, is the in the execution. So many aspects of the film come together in just the right way, with exceptional comedic timing, that you simply can't help but to enjoy the ride.,Horrible Bosses stars Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis as three good friends who all have the same problem: they hate their bosses. Albeit for different reasons, of course. Bateman's boss, Dave Harken (Kevin Spacey), is an egotistical jerk. Day's boss, Julia Harris (Jennifer Anniston), is a sex-craved maniac, while Sudeikis' new boss, Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell) is a coke head. The film gives the audience plenty of good reasons to hate these bosses, which helps to relate to the friends' idea of murdering them.,What starts out as an off-joke one night between friends blossoms into something more dark and sinister than one would think, with the three friends actually going out of their way to dispose of one another's bosses. They can't handle their work environment, and the film's script gives very good reasons as to why switching jobs really isn't an option. This is key in relating to and believing in the script.,Despite what the trailers may lead you to believe, most of the time within the film really isn't spent establishing the murders. Instead, the jokes are found within the concept, giving the three actors plenty of time to entertain you. You're not watching three men plot to murder their bosses; you're watching three men ponder the plot of how to murder their bosses. There's a fine distinction here, and the script does a great job of establishing the difference.,Seth Gordon does a fantastic job directing here, adding a layer of intensity to the dark subject matter. The script is nearly perfect, offering the right amount of dark and crude humor with a great amount of solid, unforgettable laughs.,Outside of those two concepts, Horrible Bosses really shines in two great ways. The three stars of the film, Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis, have fantastic chemistry here. The three play off of one another in such a manner that you can't help but laugh. Each is bringing a drastically different character to life (though arguably Bateman is still playing the same man he plays in every movie), and their interactions are key to the audience enjoying the film. The group truly works well together, much like a great ensemble should, and we only hope a sequel is quickly green-lit.,The other amazing component of the film is the supporting cast, which couldn't be more perfect. Spacey is clearly enjoying his dark, disturbing role as an office jerk, spending much of the film steam-rolling anyone who gets in his way. Every so often you can even catch a slight hint in Spacey's eyes that he's enjoying himself. Maybe a little too much.,Colin Farrell completely disappears into the role of Bobby. His despicable manners and attitude toward other human beings is absolutely hilarious. He's nearly unrecognizable in the part, and it's fantastic to see a role where Farrell is out of his comfort zone.,And last, but not least, is Jennifer Anniston's Julia Harris, the sexually harassing, foul-mouthed and loathsome creature. She spends much of her time on screen making one sex joke after another, and it's great to see her playing a character completely unique to her past. Horrible Bosses is easily Anniston's best film to date, though that might not be saying much.,If you've enjoyed movies like The Hangover or Bridesmaids, you'll love Horrible Bosses. It is simply the best comedy so far this summer, and deserves to be seen in theaters. It's a must-own once it hits retail shelves. Horrible Bosses is one movie not to miss this summer.,Our Rating: 4 out of 5 Reels",Horrible Bosses,9
terrible movie - thank God I didn't pay to see it.,"Got to see this as a free preview - had no expectations - for some reason thought it might be good. From the get go it was terrible. The characters were empty stereotypes - the plot ridiculous - the humour vacuous - for god sake, can they really not produce some better? All the stereotypes were out in force. There was the executives - all white. Their beautiful wives/babes/babe-courier, all white - the token black in the roughest bar in town - all black. The car auto pilot (taxi driver) Asian.,The only humour was slapstick and bad slapstick - sticking someone's toothbrush up your arse to reek revenge typical. The 'shock' elements were women saying dirty words out loud - wow. Ground breaking.,Don't waste your money, tooth enamel on this movie - go outside dig a hole, and then fill it in.

Not horrible black comedy.,"This is a good comedy with actors such as Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Jamie Foxx.

They decide to do something about them and all hell breaks loose.,The script is well-developed. The jokes are impossible but funny nevertheless.,The actors are funny and serious at the same time. Overall: recommended.",Horrible Bosses,
Easily The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen.,"Okay, I went to see this movie for a friend's birthday cause he wanted to see it desperately. I gotta say, I would've been better off letting my friend just in the theater while I spent my 98 minutes peacefully reading a book at Barnes and Nobles. This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen! Let's start with the plot: three guys hate their bosses so the best thing to do is quit/find another job? No. Report their bosses? No. Ah that's right: let's murder them. The three main characters were annoying and over-the-top. They were too stupid to actually be believable. The dialogue was just an endless stream off curse words, sex jokes, and dirty humor which is typical in ""comedies"" these days. Last time I checked, comedies were supposed to be oh I don't know funny! The movie also had no ""heart"". The writers wanted this movie to be simply another dirty, raunchy comedy with absolutely no substance! The writers could've given the ""evil bosses"" a reason for the way they acted. It could've been a movie about understand different points-of-views and people's experiences but no...it was simply a movie about three guys who want to commit first-degree murder because they don't their bosses. There was absolutely nothing funny about that concept at all.,What's up with Jamie Foxx's character who served no purpose than to be the stereotypical black guy with a criminal record and the street cred. And while we're on the subject of stereotypes let's not forget the movie's ode to outsourcing with the Indian guy ""Gregory"" operating customer service for a built in GPS. He ""saves the day"" (go see the movie if you really really want to).,My advice: don't spend a dime on this movie. Sneak into, wait for it to come out on DVD, whatever...this movie was the worst. It was over-the-top, disgusting, cartoonish and incredibly unbelievable. Suspension of disbelief is one thing but this...oh man.,One redeeming quality: I liked Jennifer Aniston in this movie. Too bad she wasn't America's Sweetheart in this role.",Horrible Bosses,1
Just ... Horrible,"This is a part review. Part because we only watched the first 50 minutes.,I try to watch entire movies of course but this one was just - disgusting. Why is it that every new Hollywood 'comedy' these days seems to feel the need to push the boundaries of bad taste ever further. Some of the language and sexual content matter of what we saw was really over the top and quite sick.,The scenario is that three guys hate their respective bosses because they are bullied, sexually harassed and the third is uncaring about the staff which is in contrast to his dead father. Kevin Spacey was good as the bully, Jennifer awful as the sexual predator and her prey's whiny sissy voice was cringingly agonising. The third boss seemed just - well idiotic.,It was so disappointing to hear the language that Jennifer Aniston spouted in the first 20 minutes and the motel scene with the three guys was extreme sleaze. The final straw for us was when they met a potential hit man (if that's who he turned out to be) called motherf****r which got repeated over and over in the scene.,That was enough for us - we left.",Horrible Bosses,1
Falls Flat.  Real Flat.,"I had high hopes for Horrible Bosses. It started out well. The first 15 minutes made it seem like it would be really good. The premise was alright and the first few minutes set up the rest of the movie well. Unfortunately, the joke writing was bad. There were a few funny lines, but they were interwoven into a tapestry of mediocrity. I'm pretty biased though because I don't like Charlie Day's shtick. He plays the exact same character as he does in Always Sunny, a really stupid guy who talks a mile a minute and if you listen carefully there's a few jokes in there. I don't enjoy that. I don't really like Jason Sudekis either. I find him bland and he plays an extremely dull character in this as well. You could take him out and the movie would still be mostly the same. Jason Bateman's character seems to be aware he's in a bad comedy. He doesn't really seem to like Sudekis or Day and treats all the wacky situations with a sort of slightly angry distaste. ,I watched Bridesmaids a few nights ago and enjoyed it way more than Horrible Bosses. That movie also had story line problems, but it had a lot of funny parts. That's all I want a comedy to do, make me laugh. Horrible Bosses didn't really do that for me, as the vast majority of its never-ending dialogue falls enormously flat.",Horrible Bosses,
Avoid this pointless and unfunny movie,"I actually created an account just to state how terrible this movie is. ,The characters are bland, and there is no reason for me to care about there lives at all. The plot rushes in to the murder theme without building up any hatred towards the bosses.,The main characters are whiny uninteresting losers with very little at stake. ,The bosses characters are equally flat. NO real tension is ever built up.,I gave up watching the movie after 45 minutes after not a single laugh,The plot is thin whit less.,Save your time and money and avoid this movie.",Horrible Bosses,1
Childish Humor for the Immature Adult Simpleton,"What makes something 'funny' is the focal point of comedic philosophy. Do you enjoy racial humor? Sexual innuendos? Poop-jokes? Silly curse words? Sardonic Family Guy-like, non-linear one liners? Lots of things can be funny. But all jokes are not created equal. ,There is nothing worse than watching an unfunny comedy; something strangely unsettling about staring at a 90 foot screen, just praying for the movie to end and knowing in the back of your mind that you will never get this time back. Why did I not just walk out? Because it was 105 degrees outside and there was a nice air conditioner. Seriously. That's why I didn't leave. ,I will not say that I did not laugh at all, because that is untrue. There were a few times I made audible chuckles, mostly because of Charlie Day, but 3 laughs in 2 hours is not worth a $7.50 matinée. ,There were a surprising number of cameos, like from Ron White, that dude who plays Bunk from The Wire, and several other easily forgettable performances by famous people I typically like in films. But just because I like peanut butter, and mayonnaise, and pickles, and feta cheese, and oysters, and raw Kobe beef, and orange sorbet does not mean that I'll add all of them in a bowl, mix em up, and hope something good comes out of it. ,Charlie Day was alright. Kevin Spacey was unforgettable. Jason Bateman was just bad. Jason Sudeikis was the worst. ,Jennifer Aniston was hot. ,So, why was this movie so bad? Comedy is a complex art form. Not everyone can be funny all the time. They can't all be winners. Not all Led Zeppelin albums rock the same. This is a case where seasoned actors and proved writers combine in a cacophony of crap and the result is remarkably unfunny. 2 stars (for Charlie).",Horrible Bosses,2
Avoid this poor attempt at a comedy,"There was hardly a laugh from my fellow watchers all the way through this film. To say this was a comedy is the biggest laugh this film will get. I could give you loads of reasons why this film is so poor but to be honest its already wasted 98mins of my life and I don't really want to waste any more, avoid this film at all costs!,It seems I have to do ten lines of text before I can submit this review so I it looks like I really do have have to waste more of my life on this earth reviewing this film. If it was a compared to a planet it would be the moon, cold,humourless but pretty (thanks to a semi naked JA). Its a shame the film set had oxygen (unlike the moon)then perhaps this film would not have been made.",Horrible Bosses,1
Stale and predictable.,"I had high hopes for this movie. The cast is promising enough, and the plot looks interesting. However, the comedy fails to deliver. The jokes are lame, the characters fake, and the movie tries to save itself with Jennifer Aniston portraying a very dirty character (yet fails miserably). I can not believe an actor like Kevin Spacey accepted this script. Really disappointed.,It starts of alright, but gets worse as the movie progresses. By the end of it, you're hoping the next frame is the credits. The film tries to generate laughter by spitting out dirty jokes...which only makes the audience feel uncomfortable, wondering why on earth they bought a ticket in the first place.",Horrible Bosses,1
Nothing redeeming in this one,"Why several notable actors -- Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland -- would sign in for this one is amazing. Don't they know someone they know might see this? It was like, ""Okay, we convinced JA to play a really slutty character, talk dirty and take off her clothes. Now, write a story around that."" Well, they didn't do a very good job. Three guys have problems with their bosses, so they decide to kill them? I guess the charming part is supposed to be that they are bumbling, foolish would-be murderers.,No character to root for in this one, no motives that anyone can get with. Laughs, mostly at other people's expense. Slow, boring -- embarrassing for the actors and their families.",Horrible Bosses,1
An insult to human intelligence,"The fact that this movie is currently rated 7.1 out of 10 is disturbing. I have sat through some terrible movies in my lifetime, but this one actually took the biscuit. Not only did it take away two hours of my life it actually made me feel physical pain, and not from laughter I might add.,The plot was so far from reality, so inane and so predictable that it was irritating rather than humorous. The jokes consisted of American toilet humour and forced slapstick. There was nothing new, intelligent or funny about this movie. If this film was meant to be a comedic satire then it failed on all levels, but I believe it was just a dumb movie.,If this is what passes for ""good humour"" then the world is in trouble, serious trouble. What happened to the days when writers had an IQ and wrote sophisticated and genuinely funny movies? I haven't seen a box office ""funny"" movie from the 2000's that has been anything other than horrible inane American toilet humour, which isn't even funny. It's just stupid! If you liked this movie than I suggest you go watch Idiot Nation and see where you and this world is heading!",Horrible Bosses,1
Not as funny as expected..watchable but not memorable,"I went to the cinema with my wife having quite high expectations primarily a result of frequent radio advertisements and probably artificially unbiased opinions of radio show presenters that ""This is a very funny movie"".,Unfortunately the reality was different, but fortunately not ""Sucker Punch"" different.,The story evolves around three friends that they face three different versions of ""Horrible"" bosses, to the degree that justifies plotting to murder them and turn three seemingly innocent good guys to criminals.,The idea surely can deliver a lot of humor, but unfortunately falls sort.,The comedy is just too over the top to become hilarious. The closest situation to reality was the one between spacey and bateman. Jennifer Anniston's persona was so unrealistic that it failed to become funny, and collin farrel was heavily under played resulting to somewhat fall on the side.,There were a few laughs don mistake me but in general i laughed less than the times that i thought ""Why do they have to be so crude and vulgar..is that what funny has become now days?"" Cant say i hated the experience..i just got a bit disappointed due to false expectations.",Horrible Bosses,6
Hilarious,"Saw a screening for this last night and I just loved it. It is hysterical from the very beginning and all the way through. Definitely stay for the credit roll.,You can figure out what the basic plot is. Three friends who all have the worst bosses and they plot to kill them. Of course, why they hate their bosses and how they go about their plan is the meat of the story and a huge riot.,I truly cannot say who was funnier because all the characters played off each other so well. Jennifer Anniston totally steps out of her ""norm"" and does a great job, too. Totally worth seeing for lots of laughs.",Horrible Bosses,9
Great fun,"Far better than I expected. On the surface it looked like a typical juvenile comedy. Also, it stars Jennifer Aniston, so you know it's going to be fairly shallow. However, it turns out to be hilariously funny, with some great comedic performances. Plot is decent, direction is fluid, though there are scenes which seem overly slapsticky or contrived. ,Performances are mostly spot-on. Jason Bateman and Jason Sedeikis don't put a foot wrong and Charlie Day is bearable. Supporting cast are excellent, but looking at the names it is hardly a surprise: Kevin Spacey, Colin Farrell, Jamie Foxx, plus Donald Sutherland and Bob Newhart in minor roles. Jennifer Aniston is very funny in her role, as well as steaming up the screen.,Great fun.",Horrible Bosses,7
Horrible leads can's Bosses.,"The bosses are excellent but the trio of leads dreadful in this pedal to the metal comedy that floors it from the start but doesn't get far with these three flat tires. Lotsa screeching but little traction.,Nick, Dale and Kurt bemoan the fact that they love their jobs but hate their bosses. Unable to quit and move on they decide to hire a hit man to off them but that goes un hysterically wrong and they are left to do the dirty work by themselves. They then spend the remaining hour plus trying to whack them in a series of poorly timed dark humored bits that fall for the most part flat on their face under the slipshod direction of Seth Gordon.,As the villains of the piece Kevin Spacey, Jenniffer Aniston and especially Colin Farrell as a coke head CEO with a green belt fulfill their part of the bargain with flying colors. Jamie Farr faux hit-man also registers but Jason Bateman's Nick is without spark, Jason Sudeikis' Kurt's smarmy confidence off putting and Charlie Day's Dale aggressively abrasive Bobcat Goldwaithe resurrection one annoying harangue from start to finish. There is no chemistry at all between these three stooges and the adolescent logic they employ as each clearly ignore what the other one says. I realize fifty five is the new forty but these guys act like thirty five is the new fifteen.,The extent of Gordon's erratic and anally fixated direction looks like he outlined a scene turned his camera on and let the three say whatever came into their droll minds; the result being blank stares, unctuous cool and whiny hissy fits. In the credits Gordon parades his ineptitude even further by showing outtakes, one of which features the zany Farrell in a drug store dealing with a pharmacist. In its truncated version it is far funnier than most of the dead wood floating through the body of this picture magnifying to an even greater degree the horrible decisions by the makers of this slop.",Horrible Bosses,4
Gracias Pixar,"Im Mexican and all i can say is Thanks you Pizax,I just saw this movie and i just remembered all my childhood with my grandparents, Mexico was represented beautifully,the music, the colors. This movie touched me in my soul and i cried a lot, i created an account just to say how good pixar made everything, again gracias pixar por tan hermosa pelicula.",Coco,10
Shocked!,"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie walking in, the only reason I was there was to take my daughter to see it is strictly because my wife said there was a short Frozen film that played along with the movie and my daughter just so happens to be the biggest Frozen fan on the face of the planet.,Not only was I surprised by Coco, it might be the most in depth best story line I've ever seen in an animated movie. It was also educational and shed an entirely new light on the background of the Mexican holiday Dia De Los Muertos.,Wonderful movie, can't say enough good things about it!",Coco,10
I cried twice watching this.,"I have always been a fan of Pixar. They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well. Then came Pixar with it's revolutionary debut, Toy Story. Funny, sweet, modern, relatable and plus, completely 3D animated, which marks the first time a feature film was completely 3D animated. And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.,Though the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.,Coco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like. I'm sure they'll like it and I'm sure you'll hug 'em all as soon as the credits roll.",Coco,10
The Evolution of Comedy,"For those still in withdrawal from the cancellation of Arrested  Development, let me write you a prescription: Modern Family.  The comparisons are obvious and with good reason. The postmodern comedy  for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested  Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and  satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy.  Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style  show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too  hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh  and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This  show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the  listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly,  clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS.  I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic  sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something  to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family.  And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant  scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the  modern family and modern comedy.  Great show. Period.  And let's get it right this time around: don't cancel good TV shows.  Pretty please?",Modern Family,10
"Stunning, beautiful, colorful, powerful, sad, happy. A joy of a ride.","I may be biased, since this movie portrayed perfectly what life is all about in a small Mexican town. ,Or, perhaps I wanted to see Pixar really get back on the game. Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.,I got my wish. ,This is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken. ,This is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.,I can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.,To watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.,Thank you, Pixar.",Coco,10
A Charming Depiction of a Beautiful Spanish-Language Tradition,"Coco tells the story of young boy named Miguel living in Mexico (Coco is his great grandmother). Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music. ,In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos. ,Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel. ,Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes. ,In high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly. ,It's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!",Coco,
Best Pixar Movie Yet!,"Yes, Pixar Animation Studios has done it again -- their latest release, Coco (2017), is not only a return to form, but also manages to be their best feature yet. From 1995 all the way up until 2010, Pixar knocked it out of the park with every release, save for Cars (2006) and maybe A Bug's Life (1998). However, after Cars 2 (2011), it seems every release of theirs has been bad or mediocre, except of course for 2015's extraordinary Inside Out (2015). Luckily, Coco (2017) manages to be the second great Pixar movie since Toy Story 3 (2010), and hopefully a return to form for good this time. All I will divulge about the plot is that it follows a boy named Miguel and his dog traveling into the Land of the Dead. From there, the story takes you to startling visual, entertainment, and emotional heights that no Pixar movie, no kids' movie, and very few ""adult"" movies have ever taken you. Yes, this is even more emotional than Up (2009) and Inside Out (2015) -- both of those films moved me to tears, but never hit me as hard as this one did. It touched something deep within my soul, and unlike most emotional films where my eyes will water a bit, in this one I began to openly weep. It was an emotional catharsis like I've never experienced before. Aside from the poignant elements, the film also manages to be enormously entertaining, with exhilarating sequences that reaches levels of fun Pixar hasn't reached since Monsters, Inc (2001) and The Incredibles (2004). They use the visually gorgeous Land of the Dead they have created to their full advantage, to provide a rollicking adventure that combines imagination and entertainment brilliantly. The other thing I should mention is the score, which is, by far, the best Pixar score I have ever had the pleasure of listening to -- yes, even better than Finding Nemo's (2003), Up's (2009), and Inside Out's (2015). I suppose that shouldn't come as a surprise, considering this is the most musical movie Pixar has ever created, but nevertheless was one of the many, many memorable aspects. In Conclusion, my favorite Pixar movies up until this point have been Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), WALL-E (2008), and Up (2009), with Monsters, Inc. (2001), Ratatouille (2007), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Inside Out (2015) not far behind. I have been disappointed by their seemingly endless sequels this decade, and by the fact that even their originals (Brave (2012) and The Good Dinosaur (2015)) have been okay at best. Even Inside Out (2015), though I love it, is still better at delivering an important message to children than it is being its own story. But with Coco (2017), Pixar has nailed it. It brought me back to childhood nostalgia of watching Pixar classics like Finding Nemo (2003) and Toy Story (1995); the fun, the adventure, the laughs, and the tears. This is what a Pixar movie should be, this is what a kids' movie should me, this is what any movie should be, and it is truly one of my favorite movies of all time.,RATING: 10.0/10.0",Coco,10
Wow. Hysterical.,"Give this show a chance. I really kind of watched it against my will, but figured I'd give it a shot. I bet out of a hundred pilots, I would like maybe one - this was that one. I literally laughed out loud at numerous parts - the way that it comes together is interesting / well-done - each couple has an interesting balance - great dialog (IMDB won't let me spell it with a ""ue"" at the end) - original characters - I'm impressed.,I don't think I've ever seen ABC come out with something in this vein. Normally their shows are a bit watered down, but this is edgy and as fresh as anything I've seen hit network TV. I know that comparisons to Arrested Development will be frequent, but I think that this has more structure. The characters aren't as wacky, but they're more believable and easier to sympathize with in my eyes. Tremendous acting, great kid actors - I forwarded the pilot to a bunch of people already, and I feel lucky that I got to watch it before it came out officially.",Modern Family,
Smart and Funny,"Modern Family is one of the best shows on TV in 2009.,It's written by smart and funny people. It shares some DNA with Arrested Development and Fraiser, but has a little bit more heart.,6 episodes in and I am still impressed and still laugh out loud.,I usually avoid ABC because their programming in years past has been terrible and vanilla. Happy to see they have taken some chances on this show and hooray for them, it seems to be finding an audience and critics love it too.,I usually hate shows with little kids in the cast... they usually end up getting used as cute crutches when writers run out of ideas, but Modern Family has been giving the kids sharp dialogue to match the grown ups.,The gay Mitchell and Cameron couple are portrayed honestly and they are hilarious.,The very underrated Ed O'Neill is pitch perfect as the grouchy but soft family patriarch. Sofía Vergara who plays his Colombian trophy wife is excellent and very funny in what could have been written as a terrible bimbo role.,I wasn't sold on Ty Burrell as the dad who tries too hard to be cool after the pilot... but he's a slow burn, and now it works.,Julie Bowen as the slightly off kilter mom adds an anchoring charm to the mix.,Every person on this show gets good lines, and the quality is holding up... I hope they win a boatload of Emmys.",Modern Family,10

Best Pixar movie yet,"Three words... WOW, what an amazing movie, the story starts getting better and better, such a beautiful story, with so much touching moments, amazing soundtrack, congratulations to pixar, total respect to you guys, Mexico is amazing!!! you learn so much about the Mexican culture, incredible.",Coco,10
Best show in years,"I just want to say that I love this show!! It is good family entertainment. I believe all of us can relate to someone in it or have a relative that can. For those of you who only saw the pilot (which I watched by accident and loved)please don't give up on it, it is really good comedy. I can't decide who my favorite character is, Cam, Phil...all of them, each week another one cracks me up. I rarely watch TV but this one has me hooked. I agree that the format is much like The Office, which I also think is funny, but the shots to the camera, the expressions are some of the best parts. We have all of the shows on dvr because my daughter and I usually can't wait till the next Wednesday to see it again! Again...Best show in years!",Modern Family,10
Well written--real laughs,"When I saw summer promos of this sit com I thought it looked forced and very predictable. As Cam would exclaim, ""Surprise!"" It is well cast, written, and consistently laugh out loud funny. The documentary camera bit is actually as well done, no, even better than one of the best, The Office. I recognized most of the talented adult cast, they have great chemistry, and it was so hilarious when Shelley Long guest starred as the ex wife. But it is the kid actors on the show who are amazingly well directed in their parts- Manny, as a son, stepson, brother, uncle, and cousin is a hoot: he can wisecrack with the best of them, and then break your heart when dad isn't able to fulfill his promise for the weekend. I always thought Steve Levitan did agreat job with ""Just Shoot Me"", on NBC and I think he and ChristopherLloyd have got a hit show for ABC. Take a look at this so ABC won't cash in on some more ridiculous reality shows.",Modern Family,9
In one word: Spectacular.,"A Pixar's masterpiece, impeccably done in terms of research (about the Mexican culture), animation, script, musicalization, direction and production. A subtle yet charming and inspiring story; with a quality of animation worthy of an Academy Award (I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the great winners of 2018); with an extremely powerful soundtrack; an excellent script; likable, well-developed and relatable characters; and extremely respectful of the cultural component in which the story is inspired. In short, one of the best landings of Pixar - perhaps repeating a bit its known formula, hence you can feel a ""back to basics"" in terms of the narrative, history and character development, but at the same time managing to stand out as a fresh and purposeful product that will undoubtedly give a lot to talk about.",Coco,10
"A colorful ode to the Mexican culture and to the family values, but that's kinda it","If you agree with the 'family comes first"" motto, but are tired of it being linked solely to the muscular bald guys and fast cars, then Coco will become a pleasant refreshment for you. A lush and lovingly made animation film based on the Dia de los Muertos theme from the Mexican culture, it is a touching experience and a joy to watch.,However, after all the praise Coco received from all around, the actual viewing experience has left me slightly disappointed. Maybe because I did watch The Book of Life, another animation inspired by the Dia de los Muertos lore and featuring the similar ""family wishes vs personal destination"" conflict, a film some consider Coco to be a rip-off of. Or maybe it's because, despite all its pretty visuals, cute characters and singing solid enough, Coco clearly doesn't invest too much into having more than a single layer of meaning.,You see, here we have a painted prettily and with lots of fizzy buoyant quirks, but still a rather simplistic take on the eternal topic of love's duality and generations' conflict. A kid who loves music, but hatred for it is a family trait for several generations, so he embarks on an unexpected journey through the world of the dead to find a way to unite again what has once been separated and to mend what was once broken. And to sing a few songs and to battle some personal fears while he's at it. There are some nice and emotional scenes along the way, and some lessons learned for some characters, but it's still more or less a linear journey from A to B where good is mostly good (although not without a typical feminine touch of a raging maelstrom of emotionality), and bad is, well, at least clearly selfish from the get-go, and then it's plain outright evil.,What is missing in my opinion is the multi-facet delivery, or at least a deeper morals of the story. Sure, ""love your relatives and do what you believe in"" is cool, but ain't it what every single animated film is eventually about? And you could reach the ending inevitable for such genre with some more convoluted and morally difficult effort than just being a boisterous music prodigy with tons of luck to his aid.,It's not a good idea to criticize art for not meeting your expectations. After all, nobody does it just for you, so why what you think must matter at all? Still, if you are not too fond of stories being rather straightforward, then Coco might feel somewhat shallow. And if you're not a kid who loves everything shiny and moving, then the second half of the film might feel kinda random, slapstick'y and, at times, on seriously heavy drugs (the color-changing monkey burping blue flames or multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya to drink an even more giant cactus' tears being some examples). For you, I might recommend watching The Book of Life instead, which, albeit arguably less glossy and vibrant visually, has a story much more complex and not stamping ""good"" and ""evil"" labels on things, thus showing the duality of people and of the life itself.,For everyone else, go ahead and watch this film. For its loving care for the Mexican traditions, sharing not just the language but also the passion for something outside the typical Western outlook. And clearly for the multiple Frida Kahlos crawling out of a giant papaya - that was hilarious beyond all sane measure!",Coco,7
Easily the best show I've seen in a while,"This show is honestly great. It is easily the best animation show I have seen in a while on any network. The second the show starts you can tell that the characters fit perfectly with each other, and involved with the craziness that happens in the universe with Rick and Morty, they are immediately hilarious and extremely creative at the same time. A couple episodes in and I could tell that this was a unique show, and that people need to be watching it because it has huge potential. And with Dan Harmon writing and directing at the helm of it all, the magic that this show brings is a rare gem in television that people need to watch.. So yeah I highly suggest this show to anyone who wants a true genuine laugh at least once a week.",Rick and Morty,10
"The funniest, most believable comedy in years","Because I have not one, but two, DVRs I'm able to give all the new shows a chance, which I did with ""Modern Family"". Am I ever glad I did!! I have found that everything about this show is believable. Though the situations that occur during any given half-hour show would obviously never all happen in that short a stretch, I have no difficulty in believing that they would all happen. I never feel that anyone's exaggerating to draw a laugh or milking a laugh. It's just the only ""laugh out loud for the whole show"" on TV today. It is, IMHO, the funniest show since MASH, and that's saying some.,There are some parallels to another of my favorites, the little appreciated ""Arrested Development"", ""Modern Family"" has its own unique flavor; and the flavor is . . . hilarious!!!",Modern Family,9
One of the best TV comedies to hit the air for a while,"I saw the trailer for this show a while back and was instantly intrigued. Shot in a ""mockumentary"" style it follows the lives of three couples who's various members are related as family members. Although the set-up is slightly cliché, a gay couple, a stereotypical family and a Columbian wife and son (from her first marriage) with her American husband, this is where the standard ends. The dialogue is fantastic and at many points I found myself really laughing quite loudly, something which is very rare for a TV show to accomplish for me personally. The casting is also spot on with the inclusion of Ed O'Neill (the infamous Al Bundy!), Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sofía Vergara, with each actor really bringing something unique to the mix. I strongly recommend this show to anybody who appreciates good comedy, the ""to-camera"" sections of the dialogue have a very close resemblance to the original UK version of ""The Office"" and for those who are familiar with this, Modern Family will be a welcomed return. Great show, great acting, great script. Highly recommended.",Modern Family,8
Succeeds on all levels,"Music is banned in Miguel's household after his musical great-grandfather abandoned his great-grandmother and her young daughter. On Mexico's Day Of The Dead festival, a convoluted series of events sees Miguel transported to the Land of the Dead, where he discovers that the dead disappear when no-one remembers them. He also discovers that unless he returns to the land of the living by dawn, he will join the dead. And there are problems ahead!,The story here is very artificially structured, with all sorts of bits and pieces present s that a predetermined trail of events can be created. But you never notice that, so natural is the narrative flow. ,This film is highly original, full of truly gorgeous visuals, lovely songs, delightful characters, and touching resolutions to several individual story threads. And yet it appeared in the UK with no publicity, trailers, or warnings whatsoever, and my local multiscreen didn't even get it in 3D despite the fact that it is clear that the 3D would be dazzling.,This is as good as any Pixar film over the last several years, and better than most.",Coco,10
A Pure Delight!,"Pixar has done it AGAIN! 'Coco' is a yet another delightful ride from the prolific animation studio, who's winning streak seems to never end. And that's good for all, since 'Coco' is all heart & soul, rewarding the moviegoer wholeheartedly.,'Coco' Synopsis: Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.,'Coco' captures the themes of Life & Death, with genuine feeling. Themes of family, passion, defeat & redemption also are explored here, but with humor & real emotion. While I laughed for a good share of this winning story, I also found myself weeping in the film's final-act. This is a true fantasy-adventure, that gives life & death true meaning., 
Adrian Molina & Matthew Aldrich's Screenplay is excellent. Lee Unkrich's Direction is colorful. And of course, the Animation is extraordinary. 'Coco' unfolds gorgeously & not for a second, does the pace drop.,Vocal-Performances are top-notch! Anthony Gonzalez as Miguel, the protagonist, is a joy, Gael García Bernal s Héctor Rivera, a charming trickster in the Land of the Dead, Benjamin Bratt as Ernesto de la Cruz, the most famous musician in the history of Mexico and Miguel's idol & Ana Ofelia Murguía as Mamá Socorro ""Coco"" Rivera, Miguel's great-grandmother, stand out. And yes, this is a Film made in America about Mexicans & their tradition. Take That, Mr. President!,On the whole, 'Coco' deserves all your time & money. Don't Miss It. Oscars, are you ready?",Coco,9
Best Anime ever?,"Once every few years Disney manages to prove me wrong that they are running out of ideas for producing wondeful anime movies based on new concepts / ideas. This movie is trully a masterpiece, unquestionably one of their best ever. I think this film is much better than my favorite of the last few years ""Inside Out"". The quality of the movie is going beyond any expectations as it is brilliantly funny, extremely emotional, and the music is fantastic. Overall, thumbs up for what I personally think is the best anime Disney has delivered in the last 20 years to say the least. 10/10",Coco,10
Very solidly constructed television.,"This is an extremely solid show. It is *dark*, but there are certainly moments that approach the limits of any sort of television style format.,The ending of ""Rick Potion #9"" is just amazing. Likewise, the end of ""M. Night Shaym Aliens"".,The strength of the show is just how amoral Rick may be; but there is a strong attachment to the ""many universes"" hypothesis within the show. Philosophers have long debated the moral implications of ""many universes"" ( while realizing it's a bit sophomoric and nerdy ) ; ""Rick and Morty"" picks at this as its stock in trade. Morty is our avatar, and works in that capacity extremely well.,The essential dyad at the center - the title characters - interact little with the more peripheral characters, who have mainly been used in B plots. This shifts of course, and with these sorts of shows they will always mix this for plot gain. There's a rich enough set of characters to provide ample space. The interaction between Rick and Morty hoists a bit from classic propaganda tropes without actually being propagandist; a heck of a trick. It must be hard to calibrate this.,The entire show is just chock full of nuggets and neither preaches nor deigns to condescend to the audience. Pacing is always even and feels right. The writers know where to push and where not to.,We will see how long this can be maintained. The writers show a gift for twisting & adding-to old plots into new shows. Hopefully that's a stable arrangement.,As an ""agent of Chaos"", Rick should serve us for many years. There are actual ideas underneath all the humor, and here's to them. This might well be the best thing on television right now.",Rick and Morty,10
"A genius mix of emotion, comedy and sci-fi!","Rick and Morty is a hilarious new show by the genius behind Community seasons 1-3 and 5, Dan Harmon. The episodes so far have always seemed fresh and the writing is hilarious and creative. But then there's no surprise really since its co-creator created Community.,The hilarious mixture of wittiness, slapstick and action all add to making this show one of the best cartoons I have ever seen.,From what I've seen so far, the show easily parodies different movies and topics, also slyly sneaking in references (sometimes not slyly).,The art also is simple, but very appealing. Because the show is animated, Dan Harmon, Justin Roiland and the writers have been able to break free from the chains of live action, making the show more out of this world.,I highly recommend this show to anyone, especially fans of the Regular Show, Adventure Time and Community.",Rick and Morty,10
getting worse by the episode,"I'm just gonna say that this show has gotten so bad lately that i started literally hating all characters. Each and every single one. Well, just about...,After pretty good first few seasons, everything that followed was getting harder and harder to watch. Jokes are so lame that elicit more and more facepalms.,The only character i still respect in this show is Ed O'Neill, and that is just because he used to be a women's shoe salesman... I will never forget Al Bundy.",Modern Family,
"Laugh-out-loud ensemble comedy; a ""The Office""/""Arrested Development"" hybrid (almost...)","I decided to check out ""Modern Family"" after hearing all of the critical praise about it. The show was five episodes in, so I caught up on the action online. And I must say that the acclaim is well-deserved. The show is nothing like what I'd imagined when I read about it. It is not a typical three-camera sitcom and it actually IS as gut-wrenchingly funny as people say.,With any modern TV comedy, people are going to compare it with ""Arrested Development"", which is highly regarded as one of the greatest shows ever by many. ""Modern Family"" is not quite ""A.D."", but I can see why some people may compare the two.,""Modern Family"", like ""Arrested Development"", is a comedy about a wacky extended family that is filmed in a quasi-documentary style, similar to ""The Office"". The characters don't acknowledge the camera, but they do contribute ""talking head"" segments to supplement the action. The show is less cartoony and surreal than ""Arrested Development"" or ""30 Rock"", but the comedy can still get pretty off-the-wall.,The ensemble cast is great. There are three branches of a single family. The patriarch (Ed O'Neill) has re-married, bringing a Colombian-born wife and her son into the fold. The daughter (Julie Bowen) and her husband (Ty Burrell) have three kids. The son (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his partner (Eric Stonestreet) have just adopted a Vietnamese baby. The show focuses mainly on the parents and how they raise their families and interact with each other in today's society.,My favorite character is Phil (Burrell), who plays the dad who tries to be ""hip"". He means well, but he's really kind of a wimpy husband. Phil's always putting himself in awkward situations (without always realizing it) and some of his lines are hilarious. He tries so hard to be the ""cool dad"". Next I like Cameron (Stonestreet), who's gay and proud of it. He's sensible and sensitive and he has some great lines, too.,Although I haven't really connected with the show like I have with some others (just a matter of personal style), there's no denying that ""Modern Family"" is an above-average comedy. It's written well, with humor sewn throughout the fabric of each episode, and each episode packs some laugh-out-loud moments. And I say this as someone who rarely actually bursts into audible laughter. (Occasionally, with shows like ""A.D."" or ""30 Rock"".) This show does it, though. Phil, in particular, has me in stitches.,To give you a comparison, I'd say ""Modern Family"" is like a cross between ""The Office"" and ""Arrested Development"". Presented more like the former, with humor and content drifting more toward the latter. More grounded in reality than ""A.D."", though, and without some of the triple-entendres and zingers.,The show finds windows to sneak in some wholesome family morals like togetherness and acceptance, but the episodes always end with a laugh.,But the rumors are true. ""Modern Family"" IS a very funny new comedy. Check it out on ABC or ABC.com if you don't believe me. (Or wherever else it's available.) It definitely should be on your radar.",Modern Family,8
Why I believe it deserves a 10,Pixar has come a long way. To them their creations have become a science into human emotion and I don't know any better company that has nearly perfected the craft. Soon they'll have 10's across the board from music to picture and from story to the characters. Never have I seen that more than in the movie WALL-E. This movie is up there. More than just its basic elements it dared to dive into a culture that very few in the world know about. It went above and beyond in research in getting those in Mexicos stamp of approval. It touches a deeper recess of the heart where the soul lies dormant and awakens it with hope and optimism. It takes the differences we often critique and judge upon another group only for Pixar to place a mirror right in front of us and stare at our own reflection. It takes the common elements so as to identify with the characters and stir a feeling of commonality. It's brilliant and ingenious. These things alone give it an 8. The 10 is because it was bold and dared to go places other won't. In this I found originality. Something you don't see often these days. Best part of all it unified. It takes ones thick skull (pun intended) and supplies human emotion as the medium to communicate the message so as to reach the heart. One may call that manipulation but due to its sincere true message and goodness I humbly give it a 10.,Coco,10
Stunning! Coco has stayed with me since watching it a week ago. I can't stop thinking about it.,"Absolutely beautiful film. It touched my heart and soul like no other film ever has. Visually gorgeous. The acting was wonderful. That little boy, Miguel, was such a lovely, likable character. I wanted to reach on the screen and hug him. The songs? Wow, just amazing. Where there clichés? Sure, maybe but it didn't matter since the characters were original. The negative and so so reviews.....sorry but you have no heart. I don't think I can trust anyone who doesn't love this film. You are not human.",Coco,10
Just as TV started to go downhill...,"Let me just say that I was very skeptical about this show. Judging from the sneak peaks and previews, I assumed this was going to be just another family guy/ Brikleberry lazily animated show with some cheap and low standards. Well gee wizz, I was very very wrong! Rick and Morty might seem like some stupid knock off of Back to the Future or some money laundering scheme as part of late night cable TV, but its not. Behind all the jokes, each episode surprisingly has a strong message and whether you can relate to it or not, you won't really feel like the end of each episode was a bummer.,The weakest aspect is the animation. Its not pretty and seems out dated. Despite this, its hard to say that this pulls the show down. No, not even one bit. The absolutely clever writing and well designed character personalities are basically what this show floats upon. ,Unlike many other cartoons that have a sub plot in every episode, the ones in this show are actually relevant and memorable. They aren't just there as fillers and they are nearly as important as the main story. In fact, in most episodes its hard to tell which one is the sub plot and which one is the main plot.,What I'm trying to say is that this show is near perfect. What are you still doing watching new Simpsons and Family guy, go watch this show if you haven't already. Its a great example of how TV hasn't turned to total crap.",Rick and Morty,8
Original and Hand Drawn.,"Heads Up: This review is based on the first few episodes of Season 1 only. I was really looking forward to Rick and Morty based on the hilarious teaser and the fact that this is a hand drawn show like older, more classic cartoons. My concern was that it would end up with a weak, poorly written script. That is not the case whatsoever. This show is incredibly original with its writing, characters, style and imagination. Every episode AND joke is completely different from the last, which keeps this show fresh and exciting to watch. While I think Rick (the grandpa) is the funniest, No character is bad. Morty, his dog Snuffles, and even Morty's math teacher all pack in great jokes. The directing is great and the art style and the way it is drawn is really really good. The only problem I have with the show, is that I don't really think they know how to end each episode (so far at least). But, this is truly a breath of fresh air when it comes to comedy, and I think adultswim has a really good show on their hands... 9/10",Rick and Morty,9
The Best New Adult Animated Series Around,"I just finished watching the first three episodes and feel instantly hooked. I have the same feeling I had when I watched Family Guy for the first time, in which I felt like every single character was interesting and was contributing for the series in their own ways. In this show, things that will make you laugh are dark and awkward at times which succeed every time. I haven't found a single bad moment so far in the first three episodes and can't wait to watch the whole thing ,The first episode was awesome and got me straight to the next. The dog world domination episode is going to be a classic, go watch it. People will remember that episode.",Rick and Morty,9
A surprise hit!,"I wasn't sure about this show. I liked Ed O'Neil and wanted to see him succeed in another comedy. I talked my girlfriend into watching the pilot episode and we laughed uproariously. The casting was so good. Ed O'Neil's delivery is absolutely pitch perfect. Ty Burrell is annoying but, in the perfect over-compensating way that you would expect from a dad who feels his Life has aged while he has remained a teenager. Julie Bowen manages to under play her role as Ty's annoyed and insecure wife. Sofia Vergara is absolutely gorgeous as O'Neil's younger, Latina wife. Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet are hysterical together. The show ties together so well each and every episode.",Modern Family,9
Once favorite show should have ended at least 2 years ago,"I enjoyed Modern Family for several years. Not every show was top notch but most were up until 2 years ago. The 2016/2017 season was awful, not one good show in the whole season. I had hopes the 2017/2018 season would get back to the earlier quality. But this show is now unwatchable. I am embarrassed for the cast members. They are getting rich but they have to know they are producing terrible work. The storylines are tired and worn. And, is every young character going to have a borderline incestous relationship with an adult family member of the opposite sex? CBS, take back your renewal and put this show out of its and our misery.",Modern Family,3
Hardly any laughs,"Not funny at all! I gave this a chance and tried a few episodes but gave up. It's the opposite of laugh out loud funny! Why do so many people like this and why does it win so many awards? The situations are so contrived and exaggerated. People just stand around looking daft and some supposed joke takes place. Hate the camera work too.,Sofia Vergara is quite a natural comic but the rest just look ill at ease and unpleasant.,This is the most overrated comedy in years. How can this compare with Big Bang Theory?,I can't be the only one who doesn't think this is funny.",Modern Family,1
My Favorite Animation Movie of the year,"Well Disney and pixar really make such a great movies this year, kinda classic, but you know i love all the character, the color of the picture , and of course the story line , story twist. It was kind of tribute to Mexico culture. I think its a good movie, we learn about Mexican culture of death too in this movie. I think it suits for family, kiddo's will like it very much. well, so far every Disney animation never disappoint me ever, not this time too. Keep a good work Pixar!!,PS: i really fascinating with the playful mind blowing color in this movie",Coco,10
Masterpiece!,"Pixar and Disney, managed to cover in the most masterful way the Mexican custom of the Day of the Dead, a cinematic experience that the world deserves to see to better understand one of the most famous Mexican traditions of this planet. This film is an offering to the Mexican people and a sort of reconciliation between Mexico and the United States.",Coco,10
This show is excellent,I absolutely love this show... Reminds me of the chemistry of Doc and Marty Mcfly from the Back to the Future series with a rated R twist. Slowly but surely the are tweaking character development. Getting better every new episode!!! I like the way Rick is always drinking and burping and slurring his speech. This show is getting a lot of acclaim with so few episodes and it deserves every bit. Honestly this is the best cartoons aimed at young adults and teens that I've seen in a years. I always get excited when I see a new episode trailer!!! Can't wait to see what direction they take this to in the future. They have set it up for literally limitless possibilities.,Rick and Morty,10
Best new cartoon show 2013!,"The show feels fidgety in the beginning. At first it makes you take a second to get used and into it. But it's as intelligent and hilarious a show as I haven't seen one since a long time! That's what I and hopeful many other viewers are going to realize after a couple of minutes. It'S one of those shows that wouldn't happen to be without Adult Swim. Not exactly a family show. Anyways - this show is brilliant. The humor is not as cheap as in most of the successful cartoons and the show is not as comfortable to watch, but that's one thing that makes it so hilarious. It's really dark sometimes, and the viewer with a good sense of humor will appreciate that. The only thing that might make the show a bit better is that the creators could make the characters a bit better known and thus more likable to the viewer. Like this a plot as in episode 6 (SE1) would work even better. Well, the characters maybe a bit flat still, but the plots and happenings are making all this acceptable. Amazingly funny and thoughtful story line for a 20min cartoon show. The sad part is, that it might not really be for the rank and file and as a result might not last for too long or even be recognized by too many people. I really hope this goes on for a while, though! I love this show - it's great. Keep up the good work,PS.: I hope they take one or two scientists on board to help them with Grandpa Rick to keep him on track regarding scientific accuracy. But that'S just a personnel tic of mine...",Rick and Morty,9
Best New Animation Ever!,"Awesome!!!! Just plain fantastic! Just what we've been waiting for! At a loss for words!! Thank You God! It's about time that writers have opened up to ideas from a new realm! This is it! No hold bars, out of this world, other dimensions, straight in your face! Brilliant! I can't wait to see more! I have to see more! There better be more; it would be pretty ugly, otherwise! Hawt-dam! Yee-Freaking-Haa! Sit down, strap in, hold on and be amazed! Super clever, great story lines, great visuals, smooth, exciting, thought provoking works of art; absolute masterpieces! I applaud the writers and commend them for their brilliance and am so excited this is happening! Rick and Morty FOREVER!!!",Rick and Morty,10
This show sucks.,"I really don't know how people say this show is good. Believe me, it's not. I wanted to see this show because of the positive reviews it has received, so I watched the pilot first. It was boring, clichéd, and annoying. Even Ed O'Neill is bland and boring, that made me sad. The normal family (Phil Dunphy) is dumb and uninspired. The gay couple is stupid and annoying. I don't have anything against gay people, but the fat one is nothing less than annoying and disgusting. The other gay is OK, but he doesn't make me laugh at all. Sofia Vergara looks too much excited, like she's hyperventilating....it's really creepy. The kids are bland or clichéd at best. After the pilot, i though ""Well, it's the pilot...maybe the second one is better...."" Well, that's not true. Everything is bland and boring at best, or annoying and unbearable at worst. The characters, the story, the comic parts. Believe me, I tried to laugh with this...I couldn't. Now for the big picture.....there is no music whatsoever. It makes you feel like you're watching a home video, maybe that's why the series is boring. And finally the worst part.....the camera....it goes up, down, left, down, up, right.....so, who gave the camera to a 15 year old drunken kid? It makes me dizzy to watch this show, and with the story and characters, it makes me sick. I can't stand watching more than 5 minutes of this ""thing"" now. So, to summarize, DO NOT watch this series, there are better things out there...in fact, almost everything could be better than THIS!",Modern Family,2
Really Bad Writing... intended for weak minded sycophants,"This show is the worst. The writing is, as if someone took cliché and patronizing story lines and ideas, pasted them to a dartboard, lobotomized a chimp and let her go nuts with fecal matter. The best part is the flung excrement, has more substance than the show itself. Did no one notice the desperation of of the casting, and ensemble of washed up untalented, familiar faces to play into the insecurities and dullness of the American viewer. This work of unintelligible garbage should to laid to rest, to make room for anything else. P.S. Anyone who compares this piece of self-indulgent, dimwitted, cliché, exploited deleted, sycophantic waste of space to ""Arrested Development"" should seek a psychological exam, because you are probably entitled to Mental Disability benefits. This show should be cancelled immediately before American Families become any stupider.",Modern Family,1
Love it,As a Mexican born child I cried when I saw this movie and my son who is American born with Mexican parents loves it too.. love to teach him about our roots,Coco,10
Pixar has created a masterpiece of cinema,"I'm no critic, but Coco is close to movie perfection. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, no doubt, and is by far the best animated movie ever created. The visuals are stunning, the characters are fantastic, the twist is somewhat predictable but still great, and the story is so touching. This is the best film I have ever seen, over Shawshank, over The Godfather, over The Matrix; this film is a godlike creation from the very, very best of cinema. Do not be fooled by the haters who say it is a poor portrayal of a tradition; the tradition is likely far more beautiful in Coco than in real life. Fantastic, I am blown away.",Coco,10
"Hilarious, smart, fresh, original and unexpectedly emotionally resonant","There were only 11 episodes in the first season, so it seems a little premature and overenthusiastic to call this the funniest and best show on television, but I'm tossing it out there anyway. ,Too much of the Adult Swim programming is mean-spirited and ugly, but ""Rick & Morty"" balances its cynicism with moments of genuine familial and societal warmth. The characters are well-developed and evolve over the course of the season, and the voice talent is gifted -- Chris Parnell is the secret weapon as Morty's not-too-bright dad. ,The Pilot is the only episode I was Luke-warm on, because it's the only one where the nastiness overwhelms everything else, but it fits well into the course of the entire season because it gives the bitter alcoholic grandfather Rick something to grow away from, and the first year gets better and better as it rolls along.,There isn't a lot of TV I can watch with my son, but this is just about the best of it. Can't wait for season 2, and I hope there will be more than 11 episodes.",Rick and Morty,10
Pure unadulterated garbage!,"I've only watched a few episodes from the first season, but, aside from not containing one iota of actual comedy, this is one of the most offensive shows ever created, and the writers should be castrated. One could understand if this were satire or black comedy, but it simply isn't anything, while it does succeed in offending practically every minority group on the planet, especially gays and hispanics. Instead of a real gay couple were served up with a couple of raving gay queens. Instead of a hispanic, were are treated to a modern day Carmen Miranda. But speaking as a gay person, this is the most offensive piece of garbage since Will and Grace. I know the networks have no class, talent or style in their work, but this is beyond all that. Simply pathetic!",Modern Family,1
One of the best sitcoms of all time. Period.,"Modern Family is an exemplary show. It's got everything to love in a sitcom. It has humor, heart, great acting, great writing, likable characters, I could go on forever. The jokes are sharp, believable and it's also not too hyper like a lot of today's sitcoms are. It has quieter moments. And not that I'm bothered by a laugh track, but it also understands that you don't need a laugh track to be funny. I love to watch it with my family every Wednesday. My family and I love it to death. It's as well one of those rare examples of a show that hasn't suffered from what I like to call ""SpongeBob Syndrome"" (With flanderizing characters, recycling episode plots, etc.). I definitely recommend it :).",Modern Family,10
"Entertaining and Funny, But Seriously Flawed, Satire","Scripted shows that employ a documentary format often use the P.O.V. talking-head shot as a gimmick to put more visual variety into the show, and to create a style of story-telling that they hope will keep your attention without having to improve the plot or characterizations. You can tell because they often go back to the interview at the most weakly-written moments. This is one problem, but not the major one, with Modern Family. The aspects that disturb me the most are these: they're supposed to be modern families and there are no working mothers (do the writers misunderstand the term ""post-feminist era""?) except for a few temporary jobs in single eps. Also there are no poor or even lower-middle-class characters. Actually, I do remember one character who was poor, but of course he was a one-time character on a Christmas episode. I'm sick of the characters whining about first-world problems like not being able to buy the ""perfect gift"" for their spouse on their birthday. What's so tragic about buying the iPad the day before or after their birthday? I realize this is a satire, but the writers don't seem to have that much contempt for the people they're satirizing. They don't seem to be TRYING to show how spoiled and self-centered many upper-middle-class are (it just comes out that way). That's not part of the satire, except maybe with the character of Haley (Sarah Hyland). Another thing that bothers me is that Claire (Julie Bowen) comes off as a lot crazier than the writers seem to intend. She's ALWAYS breathlessly freaking out, and it's more irritating than funny. In real life she's be at least an OUTpatient in some psychiatric facility. The gay couple (Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson) are gay stereotypes, especially Cameron, but since I hate political correctness and they're actually funny it doesn't bother me much. It would be nice, however, if the show did what it could to improve America's perception of gay people. Since Camoron is a prissy, whining, crying drama queen, the other character, Mitchell, could be the antithesis of a gay stereotype. The comedy could come from people thinking the character is straight. Manny's (Rico Rodriguez's) character doesn't resemble any human being on the planet. He's too cartoonish (sitcoms have always had kids who act like adults and adults who act like kids) and neither funny nor well-acted. On the positive side, Ed O'Neill is amazing as Jay Pritchett. As he was in ""Married, With Children"", he's like a comedy machine, delivering every line perfectly. To sum up, Modern Family is funny and entertaining but not particularly witty and intelligent, and uses a kind of soft-edged, sentimental satire that flatters, but doesn't challenge, the audience's ability to laugh at itself.",Modern Family,6
Must see,"In the begining I want expecting the movie will be OK, but Pixar done a great great work. Funny moments, tears, laugh all combined in this movie. Plus this is not for kids, adults can find something from this movie. Dont think twice and watch. You can thank yourself later to spend your free time. Go pixar go!",Coco,10
Solid entertainment.,"Is it legendary? Is it a game changer? Perhaps not. But it was certainly a memorable watch and deserves a solid 8/10. ,The movie brings several ideas we are familiar with to life, through the use of vibrant visuals and audio. I was stunned by how pretty and detailed the 'city of the dead' looked, I have never seen such detail in other Pixar films.,All in all, this movie expresses the familiar tear jerking formula to its entirety. It is suitable for all ages and definitely worth a watch with your family.",Coco,8
Best animation movie!,"The storyline was very unique, so was the concept of the movie. 
To everyone who enjoys watching animations I would recommend this movie. It also has a educational plot, because it shows the importance of family and a bit of the Mexican culture. It was hands down one of the best animations I have watched.",Coco,9
Simpson's haven't done it.,"I like this show,and I've told everyone from work to give it a go. For some reason they just don't get it. They're happy to watch another Simpsons episode but for this, for some reason they say no. In episode 6 ,which I've just watched, i witnessed the ""mesecks"" (i don't know their pronunciation , they yell it in a high pitched annoying sound, which is part of their charm), and they just go crazy. Homicidal crazy. Then there was Morty who was almost raped in a bathroom. This sounds terrible. It's terrible in a movie, its terrible in a TV series, and its terrible in animation. But for some reason, no, its not terrible. It's funny. I've never in a review had to justify rape in a toilet as being part of a funny plot line. Well Rick and Morty make it work. There's the father having the best sex of his life in a computer simulation,dog's making killer robots and takings us over before realising they don't want too and surviving a dead homeless guys amusement park internal organs. I don't write reviews often but every now and then i get surprised. Then the surprise is laughing, then its appreciation of the writers and makers. I tip my hat to you good sirs and madams. You have made an original, surprising series. Even if you start stealing from the Simpson's, i don't think i would recognise it because you would twist it into a creepy, unsettling, awesomely funny situation..PS they will start stealing from you soon. Awesome show. I know you can't keep going for 20 years but i would rather 1 season of originality than 20 years of same old, same old. You have a fan.",Rick and Morty,10
Just Excellent,"When I saw the 14 age rating come up on the screen I nearly switched off thinking it was a show for kids. It is not. Besides from the content being inappropriate for them it is also far too good to waste on children. The writing is excellent and Dan Harmon's creativity shines through just as it did in Community. Not one episode yet has been remotely clichéd or uninspired. Even with the frequent parodies and obvious references to classic sci fi plots and other films/shows it still manages to present them in a new (and usually pretty damn disturbed) way. Frankly the 14 age rating feels a little low given the casual planetary genocide which seems to occur in every other episode.,On that note I feel inclined to directly address the writer of the only 1 star review currently left on this title. The one wildly criticising the show for saying that god doesn't exist...,As you yourself say, it is fine to have your own opinion but in the universe in which Rick and Morty takes place it is fairly clear that there is indeed no god. The show features aliens, alien planets, alternate dimensions, wormholes, time travel, space travel, rapid cellular evolution and mutation. Deep breath. Disintegration, talking dogs, sentient robots, shrink rays, growth rays, a giant naked Santa Claus in low orbit around the Earth...,I could go on. Believing in a god in our world is weird enough. Insisting that a cartoon which features all that very non-biblical stuff still maintains that illusion is insane.",Rick and Morty,10
Forgettable & Soon Forgotten,"Imitator Family steals everything bad from the last 60 years of television. From ""The Office"" it steals hurky-jerky rapid camera shifts to try to show it is ""new""; from ""I Love Lucy: it steals contrived plots that are completely unrealistic. From ""Steinfeld"" it tries to pretend it is a ""real-life"" show and thus about nothing, even though most sit-coms are about ""nothing"" and their attempt to turn them into something. And by taking plot devices from everything from ""Father Knows Best"" to ""Roseanne"" it tries to create laughs where there are none. While Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet play horrible stereotypes poorly, Ed O'Neill is good and Sofia Vergara is very good. However, in 10 years this series won't even be seen at 2 AM in syndication.",Modern Family,2
"No, you aren't the only one who doesn't think this show is funny","I have only seen one episode, thank god. No, you aren't the only one who doesn't think this show is funny. You also aren't the only gay man offended by the stupid gay stereotypes. Not all gay men are scaredy cats. The only stereotype I saw broken was the fat gay man. They should be really modern and include a skinny lesbian. Both gay guys were afraid to stand up for themselves. Good West Side Story reference though, it still did not come off funny. That about says it all. No, they insist I drag this out! no pun intended. Obviously the episode was unmemorable or it would be easy to have ten sentences. Or even more, since apparently they cannot count. How many more do you need?",Modern Family,1
Heartbreakingly beautiful. Surpasses Up and Inside Out,"Coco is about Dias de las Muerte (Day of the Dead), family, family crises and musical passion. The posters have a boy and an adult skeleton capering through the afterlife. So you can know that upfront, Pixar is going to fully deal with the subject of death that it touched upon I UP and hinted at in the death of childhood innocence in Inside Out.,We were subtly forewarned that tissues would be needed. :),It surpasses the other aforementioned masterpieces by being more relatable, drawing on family restrictions and prohibitions (e.g. ""there will be no X in this family!"" X being ""instead whatever has caused pain to a family member in the past"". Pick your poison my reader). It surpasses them in making death tolerable. It reminds us that we should be mindful and respectful of all those who went before us. Most of all it taps on the shoulder and whispers that the temporal, the world we live in, in just as important as the next one and we should strive to keep family bonds strong. For when we're at the end of our rope, who else is there to pull us up?,Did I mention bring Kleenex? A full box. Even hard core macho men are driven to quiet sobs and immediate phone calls to mothers and fathers telling them ""mama, I miss you."",Beautiful.",Coco,10
It really is that good.,"Like it says, the show really is that good.,It's much needed also imo, television programing wise.,To me it's 90s intellectual subground --Dr. Katz, The Critic, Home Movies (yes, there all the same aesthetic which superwhelms measurable date)-- meets Futurama. World and spontaneity to Futurama; intellectual digs at society Katz and HM; animation to HM, Futurama, and actually Adventure Time even though I've never seen it. And at the same time it has something that smacks of itself and nothing else. Also, even though I didn't really like the show: Chalk Zone. Other things like Zim, Beavis and Butthead, Aqua Teen, even Rocko and Angry Beavers are thoughts but just little touches. haha I guess Ugly Americans too for Leonard the Drunk Wizard and Rick the drunk Science Genius.,And this is only from catching one episode.,If you're even considering watching this show--- do so. It's the sole reason I made this post.,To note it is hilarious, it is thought-provoking, it is A LOT of fun, incredibly imaginative, fresh; and perhaps above all, on all fronts--- comedicly, socially, politically, premise, stories, character dynamics it's not afraid in the least to try, do, or say anything.",Rick and Morty,10
The best animated series made in the last decade,"Shows such as Futurama, The Simpsons and Archer were presumed to have set the bar for animated series in the modern era. With all due respect, Rick and Morty walked in with elements from all these great shows and simply decimated the competition. The writers have undoubtedly created a masterpiece. A true jewel among the current roster for similar shows. Every episode is a roller-coaster and leaves you with laughs and thought provoking concepts. The way in which they have intertwined the futuristic elements and family drama in such a coherent and enticing manner is no joke. I've watched episodes over and over again to see if they have any discernible flaws. And I'm glad to say I've found none. The way they've set the show up allows limitless possibilities and that is great news for the impatient fans like me who cannot wait to see what they conjure up for the next season. Truly enjoyable and I recommend everyone give this show a try.",Rick and Morty,10
Why the awards?,"This show is severely overrated. I admit it is occasionally funny, and the premise of the 21st century ""modern family"" is an accurate and humorous representation of today's familial diversity. However, the acting from the majority of the cast is so pretentious and falsely exalted I have to skip through the episodes on Hulu just to look for a laugh.,By far, the saving grace of the show is Cameron - the lovably gay eccentric that this world needs more of. His mannerisms exhibit a delicate confidence and appreciation for life's nuances. If only Mitchell could match half of Cameron's genuine exuberance, they'd be the perfect family. Cameron remains my only real laugh instigator on the show.,I'm shocked and appalled Julie Bowen won an Emmy for her indigestible supporting role. Apparently, acting like a bitchy, whiny, bossy 13-year-old is what being a mom is all about in today's modern family. She'd fit right in with the cast of Troll 2. Phil remains the only bearable flesh of the family, and even he's losing my vote lately. Gloria has blatantly been mistreating and exaggerating her ""accent"" for a laugh to the point where she's probably offending the country of Columbia. And don't get me started on the kids.,Here's some advice for the producers: Replace everyone but Cameron, Manny, Jay, and Lilly. Hire some writers who know what 'subtle' and 'organic' mean. Stop giving yourselves the hype. Unless you can deliver you'll be just another rock painted gold like Lady Gaga's 'Born This Way.'",Modern Family,1
What A Load Of Shite,"If only life could be so inspired by this bubble gum family. The children get life, the parent's get their kids and it all works out in the end. As if! This show makes me scared for our future. I get it, families aren't 1950's apple pie any more and I applaud this but my god, what family actually communicates like this? Typical USA crap, directing the narrative. Give me a break, even families that aren't necessarily PC do not behave like this. What a joke. This show thought it was breaking the mould, it only cemented the crap the USA keeps slapping onto the world. Children don't talk like that, the real world doesn't care about your un-pc life. We're too busy to even notice. We don't care if you're gay, faithful or insecure. Typical of the USA to inundate the world with such dribble.",Modern Family,2
perfect family,"I just bought this after a friend of mine recommended it, because it was supposed to be so funny. And maybe it is, I'm sure it is for some, but not for me, here is why: not one single funny character! the gay couple i super annoying, the fat guy is supposed to be funny because he is fat and dramatic, the colombian kid, funny because he's fat and acting like a grown up, not funny! the women in the series, sexy super cliché all the time, not funny! the kids, not funny. the father (son in law of Ed..) is the most funny character, but is sometimes over acting his part. To sum it up, i find the whole family kind of irritating. They're always hanging out together (who does that!), pretty, rich and perfect family. I feel more like throwing up than to laugh. In fact I haven't laughed since episode two (I have just watched season one..)Maybe this series works for rich white happy families who recognizes them self in the ""funny family situations"", people who just had a baby and think that kids are super funny just being kids. Maye I am just a little F#%d up for needing more morally deprived series like ""its always sunny in philly"", ""peep show"" or ""trailer park boys"" to get me to laugh:) I don't like comedy series to be about ""learning something"". It reminds me of a modern ""step by step"", but even though I disliked that series for the same things, they at least had some funny characters and good dialog.",Modern Family,3
The Greatest Cartoon on TV,"Rick and Morty is easily the best animated show on television right now. ,The jokes are sometimes dumb, sometimes smart, and sometimes raunchy, but they're always funny. Whatever your expectations on where an episode will go are, they'll always be wrong. Nothing plays out quite like what you'd think, and every episode keeps you guessing. ,The characters are the strongest part of the show, the slow awkward grandson Morty is lovable, grandpa Rick is an alcoholic uncaring genius (who is still lovable), and the rest of the family all interact wonderfully.,All the plots that the show create come together in the end somehow, and all matter. There are no meaningless threads. ,Although the show normally has a lighthearted feel, some episodes do get darker and deeper than you'd think. I'll avoid spoilers, but especially the Episode ""Rick Potion #9"" (also my favorite episode so far). This is not at all a bad thing though, quite the opposite.,If you're tired of shows that re-use the same jokes or feel the same every episode, then try out Rick and Morty. You won't... *buuurp* r-regret it Morty! You... you won't! Okay, Morty?",Rick and Morty,10
An Astounding Work of Animation and Wit,"The fascinating thing about ""Rick and Morty"" is that it manages to be funny, thought-provoking, uplifting, and disturbing at the same time. Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon have appeared to have poured their souls into this show. All of the characters have their share of endearing quirks that is typical of animated comedies like this, but they've gone beyond that convention. Far beyond it. This is one of the only animated comedies I've come across in which the character's personal flaws actually feel genuinely painful. Don't get me wrong, I love comedies like American Dad and Futurama, but there's a certain ""sitcom"" quality to those shows' conflicts that gives off the impression that everything is just going to be okay after the episode is over. Rick and Morty on the other hand, just feels so much more human. Time and time again the world seems to find itself at threat and the characters appear to deal with it by making things up as they go--just as actual people do. The end result is a show that that feels really easy to empathize with. I also love the fact that the show manages to bring up existential issues on occasion. Sometimes they're subtle and sometimes they're not so subtle, but they're always awesome. I really think its great that a show like this is confronting such issues. The bottom line is that Rick and Morty is a unique piece of animation that deserves all of the attention its getting.",Rick and Morty,9
"Greatest cartoon ever made, every episode is like a dream come true","This show is excellent, every episode is original in it's own way, and the humor is just the way I like it. The dubbing is just great - really adds a spice to the humor, and even though English is not my native language, I can understand every thing that is being said in the show very easily. Every Sunday night I sit in my chair, get my popcorn out of the microwave, and getting ready to begin another great adventure! the only problem in the show is that it needs to get episodes more that just once a week! I really recommend you to at least try an episode, in half a day u will already be past the last one :),Keep the great job u guys!",Rick and Morty,10
This series will brainwash you,"It's entertaining but it's not a classic sitcom or comedy series. You won't have any laughter-sounds in the background and it's not so funny compared to classics like Love and Marriage or Simpsons but it's somehow entertaining because the plot is usually quite original. The fact that Ed O'Neil has a major role made me watch this, he's still a good actor and somehow I grew up with him. The gay guys are quite annoying sometimes. It looks a lot like they try to make it a reality TV show but it's not, just camera moves around like that. Weeks after writing this review I had the feeling to add some things I highly dislike: This series promotes a very negative type of family and is full of subliminal messages and tries to brainwash you. They always put the beauty of the 2 mothers Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara very much in front, character is not that important it's always more about their sexiness and makes them awful role-models. The gay-guys are nice people but this series tries to force the impression on you that a gay family with adopted child can work just sooo fine. The way they behave is always so nice and so typical TV-gay and nothing how real gay people behave. What bothers me the most is the way that those children are portraited, with their very feminine way of dressing and adult-like hairstyle they try to make them look like grown up women although they are children and trying to put a sexual focus on the three girls in this series. Especially the oldest daughter has her breasts almost hanging out of her clothes for the whole series and is usually slutty without regret. Even the youngest daughter (the Asian one) looks more like she is styled up for a ""young miss Texas"" contest than just being a normal little girl. Hands away from this Hollywood-Illuminati try to brainwash you and how you look at society.",Modern Family,1
Gag,"I do not like too many of the newer 'comedies' (Well ""Big Bang"" is a fantastic show). This show just seems like everything is contrived and forced. I did try to watch 'Family' but kept vomiting - you all know how that is. With that in mind, questions do pop in my mind, like: Why all the awards? Good question. And Why all the hype? Another good question. People do like the show - that is obvious, so maybe I am just missing something. Wait while I ponder in deep ponderance mode. Hmmmmm, what would I do to this show to make me a fan? Let me see - a-HA! Maybe if the cast boarded a charter boat, and went on a short trip and ended up on an uncharted island. That is brilliant. Would I watch it then? Would I? Ah - nope. It is not what I am looking for and I just do not find it entertaining. Show stinks",Modern Family,1
Wow! Just Wubba Lubba Dub Dub WOW!,"It doesn't take the whole season to understand the ""WHY?"" for all the good reviews of this series, as it will grasp and turn your mind upside down and inside out you mind from the beginning and have you begging for more, but those last two episodes.. WOW, nothing shy of absolute brilliance and pure art.,The depth of the Rick character is comparable to Southpark's Cartman or Family Guy's Stewie. He isn't on the other side of the glass, no, no, he is real and one day, if you behave (or misbehave!) enough, fate will make your paths cross and you will get wrecked on whiskey together and go on wonderful adventures.,As I read from other reviews, there better be more, OR ELSE...! And I think I can answer that: REVOLUTION BABY, THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING!! WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!! (but seriously, pretty please with sugar on top: don't take away our Ricksy fix!)",Rick and Morty,10
Genius!!!,"LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!! The jokes are original and very funny, and as well as that it is dark when it needs to be and has plenty of heart and can be rather emotional at times. The show has great characters and some really random ones, which is really funny and pretty weird, but mostly funny. Each episode is nicely connected with a mention to the previous episode or two, and always has cool themes and plot elements. I like the fact that unlike most shows like the Simpsons (which is dead now) this has plenty of substance to accommodate the style and visual wonder. This show is meant for teens and adults alike, and contains plenty of references to pop culture like Star Trek, cloud atlas and Garfield. I know this does sound like an understatement, but this show is literally the best, especially with all these unnecessary mindless kiddie cartoons these days which just try to be funny, and what is especially unique about this is that it doesn't need to try to be funny, it just is. Overall this show is worth the watch, you'll be amazed, and especially with season 3 on the way. Check this out, you will love it, that's a fact. WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!!!!!!",Rick and Morty,10
Absolutely incredible and unique sci-fi/adventure/comedy show. Just. keeps. getting. better.,"This is my first review of a series. But there's a first time for everything, so here goes!,My brother told me about this show. Thanks bro!,OK. I watched the pilot first, naturally, and I liked it, it's good, but then the second episode is just incredible. And then it just gets better and better. And better and better and better. Each episode is so creative, so much fun, such a ride. The writing is, yeah, so creative. Creative is a word that is thrown around way too much these days, but this show is really creative. Like, for reals. For reals ya'll.,It's not that easy to explain what makes it so good.. it's about a boy and his super genius grandfather, and they go on unbelievable adventures to other universes and dimensions. Sounds cool, but you have to see it to understand how cool it actually is. Some of these story lines, they are not like anything else I've ever seen.,The awesomeness of the story lines overshadow everything else, I think, but besides the actual plots of each episode there is a lot to like. The characters are fun, the jokes are really good, smart and fun. The animation is rather simple, but very good. So many fun creatures and wacky worlds. It's just a blast to lose yourself in each episode.,If you like sci-fi, like at all, you just have to check this out. I love it. It's almost.. genius.",Rick and Morty,10
Thrird season so so,"While I enjoyed the first two seasons of MODERN FAMILY, the third is a bit tired. Very few funny lines and situations. They should have stopped while ahead. Two season would have been great. The acting is over board, even for a sit-com. The two gay characters are horrible...both the writing and the acting. Can't gay characters act like 'normal' human beigns???? They always bicker and how they've stayed together this long is beyond belief. And these guys were actually nominated for an Emmy. Who do they sleep with? Also annoying is Ty Burrel. Lousy actor in an inane role. He too was nominated?? Give me a break. Even for a sit-com, the situations for the most part are unreal. The camera work is also horrible. Trying to be like an art movie with all that hand held camera movement and zooming. Besides re-casting, they should stop with the 'fancy' camera work. After all I've said, I do enjoy the little girl who plays Lily. She's be best thing on it. Ed O'Neil also deserves some credit as he's the only one who acts with authority and humane qualities. As for Sophia, well, she's still great to look at and at times she comes through well, but stop with the screaming. As far as the kids are concerned...again, RE-CAST.",Modern Family,4
A truly unique show,"Rick and Morty is a show that is fun, smart, dumb, raunchy, and always entertaining. On first glance, one could be tempted to judge this show as one similar to Family Guy or The Simpsons, but that would be entirely wrong.,Every episode satirizes or plays upon different concepts found in entertainment or society while also championing them. Every character, even side characters that feature only briefly, has a unique personality. Every character interaction is brimming with chemistry and characterization. The humor is well-written- not single-punchline jokes, cheap celebrity japes, or raunchy-for-the-sake-of-raunchy jokes, but jokes that play upon the situation.,No concept is brought up and then dropped- Rick and Morty pushes all of it's concepts to the limit without making them overstay their welcome. This show uses unique twists and turns to keep you hooked, making it fun to watch and re-watch. I am definitely looking forward to season 2.",Rick and Morty,10
I'm hooked!  What an amazing show!,"I watched the pilot episode and was hooked. The sick sense of humor combined with the aloof attitudes is refreshing. You can't stop shaking your head at the immense nincompoopery combined with endless genius. ,The combo of Rick, teamed up with Morty is a perfect pairing of characters and leaves a huge possibility for plot and imagination to run free.,Then I went and watched the other 13 available. ,What spectacular imagination combined with great voice acting. ,This show will rise beyond Family Guy and Simpson if they keep to the dark intense humor. ,Congrats to the writers, you're f'in amazing!!!!",Rick and Morty,10
Rick and Morty brought me back to adult swim,"Creativeness at its finest, and it clearly shows through out any site offering reviews about Rick and Morty. I try to predict the endings in every show I watch. I can't with Rick and Morty. It floats through the episode with attention gathering situations. I stay seated, fully engaged, with such an awesome plot. Laid back enjoying the show, the ending comes around and I'm up off my couch with my brain blown through my head. 10/10. I've also never taken the time out of my day to actually right a review for any other show. So this means quiet a lot to me. The creators have started the shows do not follow in order, but there are a few characters and jokes that are from the latter episode in ones later down in the season. Highly recommend starting from the first episode, even though its not really detrimental to the series if you don't.",Rick and Morty,10
Best New Show on TV,"Truly a huge surprise for the 2014 TV season. Watched the Pilot a few weeks back and definitely felt the show had potential, and thanks to its brilliant use of YouTube to post initial episodes of the show, clever marketing through the use of Instagram and amazing billboards around the US, the show has quickly gained a huge cult following. A lot of credit goes to Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland for creating a universe that is so incredibly diverse, and easily expandable, combined with a truly thought provoking sci-fi element, that the show consistently felt fresh and new with each passing episode. I cannot remember a first season of a show this perfect since the beginning of Arrested Development (and perhaps The Sopranos). These high accolades do not go without merit: the comedy is clever, the creativity resounding, the voice acting extremely well done, the animation simple but beautiful, and the character development among the best I have ever seen. ,If you are not watching this show, please do so. Reward the writers and animators of this show. Adult Swim has found its Simpsons.",Rick and Morty,10
Best Cartoon Since Simpsons,"I've been really cautious with new cartoons, especially ones on adult swim. However, after watching a few episodes in random order, I was hooked. I spend the next few days watching the 6 or 7 that were released over and over again. I didn't even have to be laughing while watching... I just felt good. Because even if you don't think the humor is funny, you can appreciate the lively characters or the well developed plot. ,The most promising part about the series is that it is literally unlimited. Futurama tried to coin the sci-fi edge and gain access to the various interesting scenarios around space/time, but fell flat most of the time. Rick and Morty so seamlessly conquered different dimensions, going into other's dreams, and even inside another human's body.",Rick and Morty,10
Seasons 1-5 are a 9/10. After that a rapid spiral downhill,"I thoroughly enjoyed seasons 1 to 5 with some of the most intellectually-stimulating and subtle humour since Seinfeld. Like physicist Sheldon ""embracing the chaos"" or using classical conditioning techniques on his roommate's girlfriend. But you did need a modicum of (popular) science knowledge to get the jokes, so apparently by season 6 they rolled out the usual array of mindless comedy writers to turn it into a yawn-worthy series of relationship clichés and rake in more viewers. When binge-watching it, you also notice disturbing patterns like the demeaning portrayals of both the men and women scientists, for different reasons. Grew up around researchers and no, they were not men-children who spent their time at the comic book store. Actually at my Dad's university they were pretty much all stable family types with successful careers, and there were a few loners, too. Like pretty much any group of humans. Lest people think this review is unfair, I have seen all seasons, hoping for a return to the cleverness of seasons 1-5 but alas it shall not be. This is one series that unfortunately will not go out with a Big Bang, but with a fizzle.",The Big Bang Theory,6
"A once great show, now a fan-fiction.","What this review might have sounded like had I written it 7 years ago. ,The first few seasons are, for the most part, extremely fantastic, focused, funny, fresh, intelligent and even at times, brilliant...Must see TV!,What this review sounds like now nearing the end of the shows run. ,A once great show which slowly starts to diminish around season 4, unfortunately. By the 9th season it seems as though the pen and paper have been handed over to teenage fans of the show...Decent background noise. ,To conclude. ,This show was once incredible, and something fresh, even at times brilliant. I couldn't wait for each new episode. Now, I watch it when it becomes available on a streaming service, and, on rare occasion you get a great episode, but it's not worth devoting a weekly schedule and sitting through all the fan-fiction episodes and story lines to get to the good stuff. The show can still be enjoyable, without question, though I find it better suited as background noise while doing work instead of must see TV that you're excited to tune in as it airs each week.",The Big Bang Theory,6
Started good and lost steam fast,"This show was pure gold at first when it was just penny and the boys: when Sheldon was never open to the possibility of a relationship because of his social awkwardness and inability to understand people, when Raj couldn't speak with a girl around, and a hot girl moves in. It was genius and hilarious. The introduction of Bernadette and Amy ruined this show. Their characters are awful and intensely annoying and unfunny. Their introduction also ruined other character's story lines. Sheldon never would've ended up dating a girl the way they wrote him in with Amy. Howard was perfect when he was the overly horny nerd, and him marrying and settling down with Bernadette ruined his character. They couldn't figure out how to keep Raj the silent character so they made him talk to girls and even date as well. Which was pathetic writing. Making Penny fit in with all of them ended up removing the hot, dumb blonde girl around nerds effect that made the show great to begin with. Now, Penny doesn't stand out as the hot girl against the nerds because they stopped writing her like that and just made it more like Friends instead of the clashing personalities dynamic that made this show good.",The Big Bang Theory,4
Used to be great....until they decided to add relationship drama to the mix,"From about season 1-3 of this show, I genuinely loved it! I got a lot of good laughs, and it is definitely pleasing for the geeks and nerds out there of all kinds! And then the show did something it really shouldn't... add more relationships, and focus on them.,From Howard and Bernadette to Sheldon and Amy and so on and so forth, the show just started to become more irritating and less tolerable. Yes Leonard and Penny had relationship problems in the early seasons, but I never liked that anyway. Now it's like they have tripled that problem with adding more couples we don't care about and constantly groan about... Well, at least I do anyway. ,Sure the new seasons still have those rare gems every once in a while, but for the most part, it's just seeing episodes with at least ONE of the characters having girlfriend problems while their girlfriends are mostly bitches. That is not what made Big Bang theory great! Now it feels like every other sitcom out there, only with a bunch of nerds.,So, I highly recommend the old seasons and even some of the newer ones, but overall, it's just losing it's edge. ,5.5/10",The Big Bang Theory,5
Maturity in the characters destroyed all the humor,"The first three seasons of this show are the worth to watch. In fact, this show ratings and success is based upon these three seasons. These seasons are mainly about comedy with little to none emotions. But as the show progresses and Leonard, Sheldon and Howard finds their life partners, whole tune of this show changes. You'll find romance, love and emotions with some dose of comedy after that. I think at this point, this show loses its main theme. I am rating it 5 only because of the first three seasons. The quality of show will start to decline gradually after season 3. But i think it shows good depiction of scientists. I also have some scientist friends who have many similarities with the characters of this show.",The Big Bang Theory,5
Was excellent before they brought in Bernadette,"This started as a brilliant show about five single young adults: four nerdy male scientists and a slutty, uneducated waitress. This worked really well. However, the makers decided to ruin this unique and very entertaining formula and put all its main characters - apart from Raj - in long-term relationships. By doing that, they've turned a great new show into yet another mediocre, couples and families sitcom.,Bernadette is an intensely annoying, condescending, manipulative, patronising, bullying, arrogant battleaxe who falsely claims to be nice. She has ruined the humour that involves Howard by changing him from a desperate single guy trying to get laid into hen-pecked, downtrodden property of hers. She's like one bad joke repeated over and over again. She snipes at Howard frequently, despite knowing full well what he was like before they married. Melissa Rauch doesn't have Bernadette's horrible voice, so I don't know why she puts on such a painfully unpleasant voice to play her. ,Amy's like a female version of Sheldon and hence is redundant.,Leonard and Penny aren't anywhere near as funny as a couple compared to how they were when they were both single.,I'd give this 9 before Bernadette was introduced and 3 afterwards. There are a lot more episodes that include her than don't - hence I've given it 5.",The Big Bang Theory,5
Jumped the USS Enterprise a season or two ago..,"Wow.. from my absolute favorite, this show has slowly turned into a sad, sad sight.. I get it: you can write only so many nerd jokes, and you can keep the show funny only for so long, but will you guys please put the BBT out of its misery already?,First three or four seasons: Solid gold; funny, good plot lines. The last couple of seasons: weak, thin stories. Writers are definitely showing every sign of fatigue. ,This is turning into less-funny Friends with a slight nerdy slant. Please end this with whatever dignity there is left, and don't let it deteriorate any further.",The Big Bang Theory,5
Another Heads and Tails,"It's The Simpsons Syndrome all over again: a show that was great in the earlier seasons (in this case, primarily Season 1-3, which I rate as among the greatest put to television), entered a steady decline, and then jumped the shark. It's no great mystery; money has once again corrupted something good.,Like with the Simpsons, the show started off with a very solid base and great writing. It had to be well written in order for it to succeed. But as soon as it became a hit, the problems started. The first thing that happened was multiple guest appearances, largely for no practical or logical in-show reason (The Simpsons ring a bell?), which was then followed by changes in the writing to reach out to as many people as possible—demographics. You see, as soon as a show, or computer game franchise, or ANYTHING becomes famous enough, it can start branching out to more people in pursuit of more money. To do this, things have to change and, usually, these changes are for the worse. Greed gets in the way nearly every time. ,In the case of TBBT, the changes were mainly designed to attract more female viewers.,The show's primary audience was originally sci-fi fans and technically minded people interested in science. News flash: that generally is not women. The show was funny because it had interactions between three desperate geeks, a genius with serious social problems, and their total opposite— a gorgeous female neighbour named Penny, who works at the Cheesecake Factory. A lot of people, male and female, enjoyed this dynamic, and there was a cleverness to the writing throughout. People more 'nerd' (a stupid word that insinuates being intelligent is a bad thing) oriented could understand the clever science references, as well.,That's all gone now. Beginning mainly Season 4 (although there were some silly individual moments beforehand), the show swamped the audience with brain-dead relationship story-lines, which a lot of women, sadly, find appealing. Also, dumb and relentless sexual references became the norm (in one scene, I kid you not, a main character goes to the bathroom to 'use her toothbrush'). 'Friends'-type crap is not what made TBBT great, but the writers don't care anymore. They want more money (and that includes the greedy cast. Look it up!). Sadly, like with The Simpsons, the show had no ending in mind when it started. There was no plan. Instead of a show that lasts a few seasons and has a respectable ending, we've got The Simpsons again—a show that just keeps on going, with no goal in sight, and with increasingly inferior writing to boot. I gave up with TBBT at the start of Season 9. Up until then, it was at least watchable. Now it's crossed over into insulting. The characters aren't even behaving remotely like they were in the first seasons, and the writers are waving a magic wand whenever they feel like it; for example, two of the main characters go from menial jobs to massive success in a very short period of time. But it doesn't matter, see. For every intelligent person that drops out, two status-quo loving, unimaginable dumb-asses have already taken their place.,This pattern happens an awful lot; there is nothing you can do except vote with your feet and watch the earlier seasons instead. It's sad that the characters were not done justice, all through the want of money instead of art. The show has become lazy, thick, and, even worse, predictable. It's over.",The Big Bang Theory,1
I can't stand this show,"I tried to like ""The Big Bang Theory"". I really tried. However, after seeing a couple of episodes from this sitcom, I ended hating everything about it.,For me, the biggest problem from ""The Big Bang Theory"" (Besides of the unfunny jokes and the awful cultural references) were the characters. All of them were incredibly unlikeable and annoying (even those that the viewers are supposed to sympathize) unsurprisingly, those characters are also clichés, perpetuating the stereotypical characterization of the ""nerd"" archetype as seen in many, many other movies and television shows, since the film ""Revenge of the Nerds"".,All the references made in this show are not only bland, shallow and forced, but also painfully unfunny as well. To get things worse, that stupid laugh track made all those so-called jokes even more irritating, as it were constant reminders to the viewers of what they are supposed to be laughing at.,I consider ""The Big Bang Theory "" to be a strongly mediocre series with overused stereotypes and flat jokes. For me, this show was like the live-action equivalent of one those lame and unfunny gaming web comics which try to be ""cool"" and ""edgy"" by including misogyny and lots of random (and also utterly pointless) nerd references.,So, in other words, ""The Big Bang Theory"" is the (stereotypically) nerd version of ""Friends"".",The Big Bang Theory,1
Not funny anymore,"TBBT used to be one of my favorite shows on TV in the last few years, the show's first 5 seasons were really funny, somehow since season 6 the show started to get worse each episode, the characters were losing what made them once great, the writing wasn't as sharp as it used to be, the show changed from a really funny and smart comedy to a boring dramedy, and the show kept getting even worse, seasons 7 and 8 were even worse than 6, the characters lose all of their funny traits. Even the girls are becoming more annoying, Amy is not funny as she used to be in seasons 4 and 5, she just complains all the time now, Bernadette became unbearable. That's enough for me, I gave up this show, I don't think writers can recover what made the show once great. I give the overall rating a 5, these five points are because of funny first five seasons, new seasons would probably get a 0 from me.",The Big Bang Theory,5
This show has become terrible.,"I used to be a huge Big Bang Theory fan for the first three seasons,but after the 4th season I just think the whole series has become a repetition of the same nerd jokes and false stereotypes.The addition of Amy and Sarah has made it even worse;Howard is no longer a funny d- bag(which I loved him for);Sheldon treats Amy like a computer program and Leonard gets Penny,and now they BOTH suck.,Chuck Lorre is making the same mistake he did with Two And A Half Men;I've now vowed to myself that I'd never watch any of his sitcoms again.There are way better shows out there(like How I Met Your Mother or Friends or Modern Family) but people still defend this show and it's pointless plot as if this was a remake of Citizen Kane.",The Big Bang Theory,1
This show is fantastic!,"I love this show!! It's one of the best sitcoms on the air and one of the best CBS shows!!! I disagree with the other comment - Barney is the best character. He's the funniest person on the show. I love how the entire ensemble has chemistry together!! It actually feels like they're friends in real life. And I don't think they need new writers, they just need to grow a little more. This show gets better with time. I laugh so hard with the show that my sides hurt every time I watch. I recommend this show to anyone that has a great sense of humor and wants to laugh until their sides hurt. I hope that this show has a long run on the air.",How I Met Your Mother,
"Seasons 1-4= 9 stars, seasons 5-... =1 star. 5 stars from me.","""The Big Bang Theory"" started off as a fresh, intelligent and genuinely funny t.v. series that hit its peak during season 3. Every episode had a clear plot that involved one or more of the five central characters that had relevant jokes throughout; as well as many irrelevant to the plot but relevant to the overall theme. ,During season five, however, the show started to change as it gained popularity. Instead of a fresh, intelligent show; it became the same ""relationship therapy"" show that has been regurgitated on E4 for years. Now, a once funny and insightful comedy that gave nerds the spotlight is a dull, familiar and used programme that recycles the same jokes and situations every few episodes.,For those of you who believe that TBBT is as good as it ever was, I ask you to watch an episode from seasons 1-4 such as:""The Pancake Batter Anomaly"" or ""The Tangerine Factor"" from season 1; ""The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis"" from season 2 or any episode from seasons 3 and 4 then compare it to an episode from the other seasons. You will find a tremendous difference in plot and character quality.,I am deeply saddened that the once brilliant t.v. programme ""The Big Bang Theory"" has been sold out. My advice to anyone who has not yet watched it is to stop after season 4 as the later seasons will only sour your taste after an incredible time of watching the first four.",The Big Bang Theory,4
"CBS, please keep this on the air!!!!","When my boyfriend tuned into the premiere I thought the show was going to be stupid. I was so surprised. This is the first TV show to really showcase nerds with pretty much dead on accuracy. This has a sparkling cast (Jim Parsons is the new and improved David Hyde Pierce) and fantastic humor that ranges from light slapstick to seriously quick wit. This show is a great love letter to nerds, and as such any nerd should give this a try. With a bunch of new (and very lame) shows debuting, it's good to see something worth watching! This premise isn't exactly new but the execution is nothing short of brilliant. Give it a shot!!",The Big Bang Theory,10
"To Start Out With Anyway, Very Overrated","I am chiming in about this show because I am surprised at how positive the reviews are trending for it. After reading positive buzz over the past several months, I have finally had the opportunity to watch Orange is the New Black. And I am very, very unimpressed.,Now, as a disclaimer, I've only watched the first couple of episodes. So I cannot comment on the rest of the first season. But from what I did see, my observations are as follows:,The Good - The premise is undeniably compelling, even if it is for salacious reasons. The title is cool and clever. Laura Prepon. A different role for Kate ""Captain Janeway"" Mulgrew. It's cool to support Netflix's pioneering spirit.,The Bad - The writing. The lead character and her fiancé. (Those are two HUGE negatives, though.),I was expecting an intelligent drama. Maybe my expectations were off, or unreasonable. Is this show a black comedy? It seems like it at times, but the ""humor"" is very lowest-common denominator, often employing very cheap-feeling shock value. Others have suggested that this show gets away from clichés...I don't know, maybe in some isolated cases, but on the whole it strikes me as extremely clichéd.,The lead character is utterly unconvincing, annoying, and uninteresting to me. In the bad sort of way, the not-worth-watching another episode sort of way. Perhaps I am being too hasty in my judgment? Overall, I can see why this show draws viewers. It is compulsively watchable in a certain way. But not the way that deserves high quality ratings, in my opinion.,I approached Orange is the New Black with an open mind, by the way. I simply feel that it is not very good. Certainly not to be compared with the best shows around. Are we watching the same show here? I applaud Netflix for the effort, but would suggest that there is huge room for improvement, based on what I have seen.",Orange Is the New Black,5
Good laugh for late twenty-somethings,"I've enjoyed the first few episodes of this post ""Friends"" comedy. It really captures some of the humorous albeit awkward situations that late twenty-somethings are finding themselves in these days.,Alyson Hannigan once again presents her hilarious, quirky sense of style and humor. Along with her boyfriend, Marshall, they are an excellent representation of the couple who are trying to figure out an identity in the ""not still partying like college kids, but trying not to be all grown up"" stage of life.,The lead character, Ted, provides great entertainment. Audiences will be drawn in by his sensitivity and likability. He's not desperate to get married, but merely ready to find the One, tired of game playing.,Overall, I think this is a half-hour well spent. The humor is edgy, unpredictable, and you will find yourself reminiscing about those first few years after you graduated from college and struggled to find yourself out in the ""Real World.""",How I Met Your Mother,
I hope this show is kept,"I don't know if I have enough to say to fill up ten lines. I basically wanted to say that I think this is a funny show, and I hope the network keeps it. I especially like the twists and sense of mystery.,I've liked Alyson Hannigan for quite a while, and I think she's doing a great job in the first adult role I've seen her in (I can't believe she's already 31). I also think Doogie, I mean Neil Patrick Harris, plays his character really well. If you haven't seen him in ""Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle"", you should. Josh Radnor also does a very good job in his first leading role.,I agree that everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, but I think this show has a lot of elements that make a good series: good plot, good writing, good acting, and attractive cast). I think previous series like ""Friends"" have raised the bar very high for new sitcoms, but I hope that even if a series isn't destined to become the next ""Friends,"" it can still be recognized as a good and worthwhile sitcom.",How I Met Your Mother,
"FUNNY and sweet, too!","I requested to see this movie for Mother's Day and I saw it with my son and husband. The movie delivered exactly what I hoped for: lots of laughs. We all three thought it was great. It was funny, and it was sweet, too. I highly recommend seeing it.",Life of the Party,10
Please cancel this show.,"I am a Yuge fan of this show but there's a distance of heaven & hell between Season 1 & Season 10 of TBBT. This show is currently running through its worst phase. The quality of the show has hit rock bottom. Kaley looks much older than her actual age. Johnny has become fat with soft belly. Jim looks old & his acting became stale. Simon has become less funny. Worst of all is Kunal Nayyar. Man he stinks! His acting stinks. His character was good in 1-5 seasons.And it started deteriorating since then. If anyone were to be fired on the show that would be Kunal. Girl friends/Wives are not funny anymore. This show should have been ended after Season 9. It would have went down in the history as one of the best TV Shows. This show has become as awful as Friends when the show was in its 10th season.Hope Chuck Lorre doesn't kill this show by dragging too long like he did with Two and a Half Men. Jokes don't work.Actors look Old & fat. It is said that this is the last season. Hope he ends well.If not,CBS might even cancel this show. Please don't drag it & end this show after this season. Win-Win for all!",The Big Bang Theory,1
The downward spiral of a once great show.,"At one point, the Big Bang Theory was one of my favourite sitcoms of the past 10 years. The first season I thought was great, with jokes enjoyable without understanding the subject matter, but even better if you did. Though the very caricature like characters (mainly Sheldon) did take a way from the realism, it didn't detract from the show as all I still found enjoyable. The only real problem I had was with Penny. Penny is a character that had little to no personality beyond being the ""hot chick"" and was either obnoxious or boring. She was used mainly to explain things to the audience, which it being a wide appeal sitcom is excusable.,Season 2 felt like much of the same, which was good so no real complaints here. Leslie does appear a lot more in this season, and I found her to be a weak character, but some like her so I wouldn't say this season's enjoyment is affected by her.,Season 3 is where I feel the show went downhill. With the introduction of Bernadette and Amy, and a shift of character from most of the main cast from nerds to nerd stereotypes, it's pretty clear that they tried make the show appeal to a larger audience, and by doing so alienating those who liked the clever and nerdy jokes with multiple layers to appreciate. ,All of the characters become creepy and unpleasant the further the shows go on with the butt of most of the jokes becoming the nerd stereotypes, becoming just another shallow sitcom. A friend describes the show as ""Nerd Black Face"", which though it sounds extreme, when you really think about it is quite accurate. I haven't seen every episode after the 5th season, but what I have seen is nothing new, besides the character's relationships with each other changing over time.,Overall, I would say the show is still alright, but not the clever comedy gold it's praised to be.",The Big Bang Theory,6
This has rave reviews and I'm really not sure why.,"is it because of the occasional lesbian sex shown in a very coy way ? or is it the odd flashing of a stray breast ?,This is not Oz in a woman's prison. This is a watered down prison soap for people that want to pat themselves on the back for watching something where the word cwnt is mentioned occasionally and could been seen as 'close to the edge'.,The characterisation and acting is actually fairly good and the lead character is likable. ,The problem is the saturated fat instead of substance. The fact that you have to disengage brain too often to watch it. The proposition that virtually all prison inmates are mentally challenged but only one is mentally ill and where the racial stereotypes are laughable. ,The black population are a cross between whores and comic children's toys where the black doll has floppy hair and does high fives repeatedly. Their speech and patois is a racial parody for American white middle class to look down on. There isn't one black person with a brain or a motivation apart from deep fried chicken and an impulse to dance at the drop of a hat.,A good example being the storyline of the mobile phone hidden in a wall. It's being used for entertaining an inmates boyfriend by her sending him 'shocking' pictures of her punani. Just one minor problem... how does she charge it ? ,so it's not Oz, it's not close to Oz more's the pity.",Orange Is the New Black,4
Just go and watch Prison Break... You will enjoy it 100 times more guaranteed,"I seriously have no idea how this got 8.3 i couldn't see more than 5 episodes (and believe me i tried). I think this series is just a ""girly"" version of a prison. I mean the worst thing that happened to the protagonist was to not eat for a day or two , watch some lesbian (witch she liked), get commented for her boobs (which again she liked) and cut some of her hair for another prisoner's hair.. WOW SO HARDCORE.In prison break you will see exactly what you want to see. You will be on edge every few minutes and the plot twists are endless.,P.S. Shame on the user who dared to compare in his review this highly overrated series to Breaking freaking Bad one of the gems of the 21st century",Orange Is the New Black,1
Absolute Garbage!,"I'll be brief and to the point.,Like many, I anticipated the third season with hope to be entertained and to see characters develop through great story accompanied by great acting. I saw none of this. Season two frustrated me for five episodes before an actual story emerged. Season three, not only didn't bring a story, characters wandered aimlessly for thirteen painful-to-watch episodes before finally drowning in a lake. ,I'm not sure what Jenji Kohan and the writers were thinking when constructing the season. You have a main character in Piper and the best you can do is make her the king pin of a... used pantie business? Seriously? And what was the point of Alex Vauss? What was the point of most of the characters. We all know why Poussay got another season but I'll leave off-camera b.s. alone. THERE ARE TOO MANY CHARACTERS ON THIS SHOW, most of them useless and not contributing an ounce to the story. I said last season that you could cut the cast in half and still have the same outcome. The writing is as poor as it gets. The back stories of EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER was so awkward, most had hardly anything to do with, well, anything. ,So much for being brief. Suffice it to say, since watching this garbage that people seem to rate highly (Obviously those people haven't watched the masterpiece WENTWORTH), I've completely shut myself off from watching Season 4, hopefully the last season. Thirteen hours of my time this season can't be reimbursed by Netflix and I'm not about to invest any more.",Orange Is the New Black,1
Grows on you,"Watched the show, thought ""Hm, I haven't decided if it'll stay or not"". But then the next day, my husband and I are quoting it and want to watch it again. ,We try again the next week, again with the quoting. I haven't watched a show where there are lines that stick with me like this for a very long time. The show wouldn't be anywhere without ""Barney"", but somehow none of its faults matter because I enjoy it just too darn much. Every episode there's a new line, haven't been disappointed so far, hoping it continues and gets even better.,I mean come on, with lines like: ""Suit up!"" ""Phone Five!"" ""Not awkward guys, its only awkward if we make it awkward"",And the numerous variations of ""suit up"" are a hoot ""Snow suit up!"" ""Flight suit up"" I gotta say, I just enjoy it. ,There isn't great philosophy, it has a laugh track, but I don't miss it and end up watching the episode a couple times because its the only things worth watching sometimes.",How I Met Your Mother,
How I Met Your Mother is the best new show in a very long time!,"How I Met Your Mother is so worth watching! What great characters and amazing writing! This show is a Hit! Finally something to tune in to on Monday nights. Not since Friends have the characters on a sit com bonded like this. I love that there are 3 guys and 2 girls..The writing is fresh and in control and productive.....I particularly enjoy the Ted with the shirt episode - what a unique story line and all the characters just seem to work so well together. I love the added suspense of ""who is Ted going to end up with"". The character of Ted does an amazing job! He has such a cuteness and innocence about him that makes the whole premise of ""How I Met Your Mother"" really work and keeps the audience so tuned in to find out what is going to happen next!

Keep Monday night TV rolling along! Yeah!! Hilarious!",How I Met Your Mother,
My favorite show on TV behind only Seinfeld.,"What can I say about this show? The cast is awesome. The writers rock. The show is great. My favorite character is Barney. He is probably the main person I watch the show for. He is funny and brings a certain ""something' to TV that it needs. It is totally the best new comedy in awhile. While it does have a laugh track - it isn't needed. Bob Sagget is right at home on this show playing the Dad. I think it is very fitting for him to be playing that role. The rest of the cast is great also. The guy who plays Ted is great at being the 'every day' guy and Marshall and his soon to be wife, Lilly are perfect together. As for Robin, well she is Robin and there is nothing wrong with her. I think everyone on this show including the regular cab driver are great. This show has everything and I hope everyone gives it a chance. I love it. It is legendary. Till next week Barney.",How I Met Your Mother,

Quickly Degrading,"Season 1 was a refreshing experience. An innocent educated woman sentenced to jail makes up for a great story to tell. The plot is centered around Piper's troubles and tribulations in dealing with her new life as an inmate, it made me curious enough to watch the whole season, and I liked it. Season 1 turned out to be very successful, the dramatic/comic entertainment value was undeniable.,Season 2.,Eager to cash in in their success, the producers must have felt the need to extend the life of the series. Their approach is to develop circumstantial characters as part of the main plot. Risky business!,So, we are no longer following Piper, but a bunch of other uninteresting characters that completely change the entertaining tempo of season 1. The intent is to slow down the show in order to cash in their success. The problem is that they have transformed an interesting story into an inmates soap opera. They attempt to provide continuity by maintaining a similar comical approach to rough situations, and by the already established sexual tensions, mainly on the lesbian side.,I watched season 1 in 2 days, but I can't watch back to back season 2 episodes, I have lost a lot of interest as I feel manipulated by a degrading plot that no longer appeals to me at any level. I am half way into season 2, and I doubt that I will finish it.",Orange Is the New Black,1

"Boring, that is all.","I'm probably in the minority when I say this show is boring.

It is basically forced comedy with unremarkable jokes, boring stories, and goofy characters.,I haven't watched many sitcoms since the late 1990s, but this show reminded me why I stayed away from them. Unoriginal and uninspiring stories with no substance and with forced humor basically describe most of the TV sitcoms Hollywood dishes out today. I've seen better shows canceled after only one or two seasons. I'm sorry to any fans out there, but I think this one's gotta go. I'm sure there are better writers and actors who could give us more entertaining stuff than this.,Grade F",The Big Bang Theory,1
Very funny show,"I found the show to be very funny. The laugh track needs to go though. I was afraid that the girl would be portrayed as a really stereotypical dumb blonde. I was glad to see that she is not. Granted she isn't a nerd genius like the rest of the characters, but she is just your average person. There is a lot of subtle humor mixed in with the obvious jokes. Good show and I hope it lasts as there are very few comedies on Television now that can actually make me laugh.,Before 100 people insult my taste, humor is subjective. If you can identify with the subject matter, it is funny to you. If you can't, it isn't. Having worked in Information Technology for over 25 years, I can see a lot of myself and my friends in Sheldon and Leonard.,By the way, if you are my age, you may get the nod to one of the greats of TV comedy in the lead characters first names.",The Big Bang Theory,8
It's like the first few seasons of Weeds,"It brings back memories of Weeds. You know in its glory days. The first few seasons before it went off the rails. That's what ""Orange Is the New Black"" is like. Equal parts funny and sad. A mix of true pathos and yet true honesty and beauty coming from the strangest places. Be warned however there is plenty of lesbian sex and if the ""F"" word makes your ears bleed it is probably a good idea to turn back now...This isn't OZ but this also isn't Disney. This is a true winner from Netflix and tells an interesting story not only from the main character's perspective but from the other inmates as well. It would have been boring to see things from just her point of view.

Let Me Save You Some Time,"Jason Biggs is one of the least talented actors in the history of film. His chief claim to fame is an almost psychopathic need to have us view his penis on film.

Orange Is The New Black is proof positive the public will buy anything. It's the same episode one after the other. Oh, the players and plots change ever so slightly, but there's only so much you can do in prison. Here's how it goes: Show lots of bare beasts. Shower scenes make this a no brainer. Show women, especially women of color as skunks and untrustworthy bullies. Have some lesbian kissing. More bare breasts. More bullying of the skinny white girl. Body cavity search...please bend over.

Getting duller with every new season,"I used to be a huge fan of How I met your Mother. I thought the show was brilliant. It was fresh, different, with new faces and had a really cute story line. I swear, the first two seasons were hilarious. The 3rd season wasn't too bad either, and now that they are running re-runs of season 1-3 on TV where I am, I've learned to compare the show from then and now. What happened, dear writers, producers, directors and actors?! How I met your Mother at its later season is just becoming dreadful. Obviously the writers are struggling to give it more staying power on the airways, but prolonging the episodes with extremely annoying story lines are really going to throw your fans off. And worst still, the show isn't funny anymore.,I mean, honestly, adults at their age in real life do not at all behave like that. Instead of adults in their late 20's, they're all beginning to sound like clumsy aloof teenagers. It's really getting very annoying. And Ted, who was very likable in the beginning episodes, has gone to this pathetic, needy, clingy and whiny plus boring individual. And then there's Lily and Marshall, who are married now and are trying to conceive, but have gotten over the top mushy with each other that it makes me gag.,Barney's probably the only person to watch for in the series. Although I vouch that it will get old soon. How many more women can he sleep with? How much more of a sleaze will he become? As for Robin, well, I had no confidence in her staying on in the show, and she truly brings no chemistry or any presence at all. If she weren't in the regular cast list, I still think the series could have taken off. She'd probably do better as a guest star.,Some of the episodes don't even make any sense, no was there really any reason to turn it into an entire 20 over minuet episode! It just contains extremely boring and annoying sequences that have been repeated too many times throughout the other seasons. I don't even find myself smiling once with the newer episodes.,And as some of the reviewers have said here, with 6 seasons running, none of them have really made any progress throughout the years. I am sad to see this show go down the drain. As to those who compare it to FRIENDS, I'm afraid this show will never come even close to being how amazing and funny FRIENDS was. With good shows like HIMYM turning horrible, I'm surprised good comedies like Gary Unmarried have been canceled, and time slots are given to comedies that have deteriorated.",How I Met Your Mother,
Watch iT!,"When ""How I Met Your Mother"" first appeared on the small screen, I refused to watch it. But then I watched an episode (I think it was Episode 5 when they went to a club) and a thought it was pretty funny. I must admit that the new show isn't laugh-out-loud, slap-your-knee HILARIOUS...but it has potential to be great! Every character in the CBS show (5 in total) are likable but I must give extra kudos to the characters played by Alyson Hannigan (Lily), and Neil Patrick Harris (Barney). I may be biased towards my liking of Alyson Hannigan's Lily (due to her previous comedic roles: American Pie Series, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but she brings a charm and charismatic flair to the show. Also Neil Patrick Harris' Barney is GREAT!!! He basically plays a creep which I'm sure everyone is familiar with (because I know I sure am!). I find Barney hilarious!!! He IS that creepy guy at the club but that's what makes him lovable.,All in all this show has potential! As long as the stories, acting and writing keep up then I am definitely going to tune in! I think once people start getting to know the characters better, they'll start tuning in as well. Everyone always compares this show to ""Friends"" which didn't really get popular until after the first season. Hopefully, this show will continue to be funny and exceed our expectations. But WATCH IT!",How I Met Your Mother,
love it,"well. if you just look at the title, its most likely you would think its some crappy show that will probably be cancelled the first season for being extremely lame and incredibly boring. honestly, i felt this way about this show when i saw what it was going to be called..""How I Met Your Mother"". Come on. thats what most people would expect.,well, if people gave it a chance, its actually a really cute and hilarious sitcom about the main character Ted pondering on his love life and looking for ""the one"". Josh Radnor I've never heard of before, but i really do like his humor in the show. it's a strange kind of humor to me though, almost dry humor. The supporting characters give great comedy to the show, esp. Neil Patrick Harris' character Barney. (who's my favorite character in the show). Man, his character cracked me up in the pilot. I laughed continuously when everyone kept on dismissing his ideal of them all wearing suits. Its great that Doogie finally comes back to television in a great new series. Their are other great characters i feel give great comedy to the show such as the couple Lily (Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segal) who make a great team. They have those romantic, but hilarious scenes together where you have those laugh out loud moments. Then you finally have Robin (Cobie Smulders) who is seen as ""the one"" at first, but turns out to not actually be Ted's future wife. She has her funny moments, but i don't really see her as funny as the rest of the characters.,Thats basically what people need to know about this show. Most of the actors we have never heard of and haven't seen in movies or shows in awhile, but this is great stardom for them. It's a great show for everyone to watch for it has great comedy and writing to it. It's nothing really what i expected though when i saw the previews for the pilot. Just give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed. It def. has a potential to last some more seasons.",How I Met Your Mother,
DON'T BELIEVE THE HATERS!!!,I have no idea why some people are hating this movie! I think it's funny and amazing! Melissa McCarthy is the BEST! Please rate this a 10 or at least 9.5!! I think everybody needs to see this movie!!!,Life of the Party,10
So funny,A lot funnier than I expected! In he beginning there were some okay jokes but I was almost crying of laughter for most of the movie.,Life of the Party,10
as may have been mentioned before.....,"This type of film is not going to change the course of humanity, but then neither will most of the movies coming out of hollywood. This is a bit of fun, a pleasant couple of hours with laugh out loud moments. It's not offensive, it's not particularly radical but it IS entertaining and that used to be enough. Apart from wondering why she waited for the husband to divorce her, it was plausible and just silly fun.",Life of the Party,8
Just Awful,"Is this what comedy for smart people is supposed to be? I found nothing in anything they say that is even even slightly funny. I am a geeky physics student myself, yet, I have nothing in common with any of the characters or the things they say. Many of the jokes, and I use the term 'joke' loosely, may be smart but completely lacking in humour.,The main character Sheldon is simply rude and offensive and I personally would slap his face if he spoke to me the way he speaks to others. He is just annoying. Is this the big joke I am missing? Is his rude and ignorant behaviour supposed to be funny? ,Maybe it's just me, but I don't get this show. It is boring.",The Big Bang Theory,1
"Please, cancel this show and put it out of our misery.","What can be said about a supposed comedy where one of the lead characters has to be explained as having a form of autism to explain why he's so offensively annoying? ,That it should never have been green-lighted to begin with.,Big Bang Theory is possibly the least funny series to be passed off as a comedy since My Mother, the Car. The character of Leonard is actually tolerable, but Sheldon is repulsive! His sarcasm, rudeness and general nastiness is enough to make a viewer want to do him serious bodily harm. The cute blonde is eye candy to make the scenes with the dweebs tolerable, but other than that, this series is stultifyingly unfunny. The 2 AM test pattern on a Detroit public access channel has more entertainment value than The Big Bang Theory.",The Big Bang Theory,1
Jumped the shark,"The show has lost its steam. After the first season, it became contrived and the writing worsened with every episode. No evolution of characters or any arcs that we can get behind and support.,Even Piper, the lead, is the most boring, flat character in all of television. Jenji Kohan has a reputation for bailing on shows when they start to go downhill (ie Weeds.) The current season is centered around UNBELIEVABLE events transpiring during a so-called riot (lifted directly from Oz, gun and all) with most eps not really making any sense or telling any kind of story.,I know people think this show WAS great. But time to be honest...,It is over. RIP.",Orange Is the New Black,2
Television At It's Best,"Netflix bats it out of the ballpark again with another original, intelligent comedy from the Jenji Kohan, the incredible writer who brought us Weeds! I was hooked from the moment it opened. I wasn't familiar with Taylor Schilling, but I am now a big fan. She's totally charming as the lead and there's a lot of heat between her and fiancé, Jason Biggs. The inmates are a crackup. It's inspiring to see a bunch of women who aren't the same clichés we've seen over and over again. In Orange is the New Black, Kohan pushes the boundaries in the same way she did with Weeds. She somehow manages to make her female leads into adorable victims of circumstance, even if they are criminals. I enjoyed Weeds to the very end. Can't wait to see how this series unfolds!",Orange Is the New Black,10
Stopped Wachting in S4 - Your Daily Prison Soap,"It's a shame, because I initially really liked the show, the first season was so great, but I have to say that I stopped watching it in S4 (I just skipped many parts up until the finale).,I stopped as soon as I heard the show has been renewed for a 5th 6th and 7th! season, and after S3 and S4 (altough S4 was indeed better) there are plenty of shows out there worth watching, and OITNB is not one of them anymore.,There are basically 2 main reasons for that.,The show basically has become a daily soap in prison, there is in fact no main story line anymore, I even would go as far as to say that there is not even a single real story line anymore in the show. It's daily life in prison, seasoned with a little drama that goes nowhere, it feels exhausting, it feels like you are stuck with the characters in prison, waiting to do your time. I don't see where the show might go in the following seasons, but I don't care about endless cycles of soap- or telenovela-style story lines with dozens of characters.,And that brings me to the second main reason I stopped watching, the characters. I S1 the show had a main story line and some main characters, we were getting to know Piper (if you like her or not, I know her character is controversial, to say the least) and her transformation as she spent time in prison. In S3 and 4 that is all washed away by adding more and more characters without getting rid of old ones. It's even hard to recall all the names, let alone all their stories that are detailed way to much in dozens of useless flashbacks, and again lead nowhere. It's like the showrunners are thinking: ""Well, we don't know what to do with the story line anyway, let's throw in even more characters"". Unfortunately I stopped counting, and I stopped caring about them, it's just to much, it's like and endless mix.,I get that the show touches some recently important subjects regarding prison life, and the system in general, but that's not enough for me, farewell OITNB, I'm sorry.",Orange Is the New Black,3
Cute Little Show,"I don't have much in the way of a review other than to say that based on the pilot, I think this show has a lot of potential to be a really good show. The cast is funny and endearing and the premise is fun. It might not be the most original idea for the show (think Wonder Years) but it has it's own little twist that should make for some interesting episodes. Hopefully next weeks episode will be just as watchable and entertaining. If you haven't checked it out, I recommend that you do. Alyson Hannigan and Neil Patrick Harris are the perfect complements to the show. The rest of the cast is somewhat unfamiliar to me though I must admit. I recall seeing Jason Segel in Freaks and Geeks, but I haven't really seen him in anything as impressive since so hopefully he'll bring the same originality he showed as Nick to his new character, Marshall. Josh Radnor is the newcomer in the bunch and he is just perfect for the part. He's cute yet dorky, with a lovable charm that will certainly endear him to many female viewers. I see only good things on the horizon for this show and I hope it finds a permanent home at CBS.",How I Met Your Mother,
"Until season 5, epic. After that, avoid at all cost.","This review will fall into two pieces, inspired by the latest 2 episodes ( seriously guys, what the f... is going on with the musical bits and ridiculous rhyming).,Until season 5, somewhere mid-season 6: some of the best comedy I have ever seen. Hilarious, right on the spot, with great one-liners and characters. Absolutely wonderful.,Anything after that: what the f... went wrong? Lame jokes, terrible musical bits, awful dialogue, just plain awful TV. And yet somehow, I am still watching, just to see the last episode. Com' on guys, this should have finished 3-4 seasons ago: on your epic legendary peakness.,Thanks for all the wonderful laughs, but wow, you really overstayed your stay!!",How I Met Your Mother,7
"Pretentious Show Aimed At Teens? Should Be Called ""Dowisetrepla""","I bought all seven seasons on DVD because my coworkers raved about how funny this show is. OK, I wasn't impressed with the pilot, and now that I'm on season three, I can say without a doubt that this rehash of old ideas doesn't get any funnier. In fact, I have yet to laugh at a single joke.,To be fair, if they got rid of Ted (fiery car crash, anyone?) and canned the writers, the rest of the cast might have potential. Neil Patrick Harris, Jason Segel, and Alyson Hannigan are certainly knocking themselves out. But let's deal with what we've got, rather than what it could be.,What we have is clearly a rip-off of Friends, among other shows. ""Vomit free since '93""? Seinfeld. Pretending to be a tourist in your home town in order to pick up women? Seinfeld again. And the moustache fetish/attraction from the tattoo removal episode? Threes Company. I could go on.,And speaking of the tattoo removal episode... Seriously, it takes the doctor TEN weeks to tell Ted the reason she won't date him is because she has a daughter and thus devotes all her time to her child. Who writes this nonsense? A normal adult would just tell the guy the reason in the first place... But then that wouldn't open up the situation for all kinds of hilarious hi-jinx, now would it, kids? ,These so-called ""adults"" live a goofy, adolescent lifestyle, like no university graduate I've ever met. It's almost like a 14-year-old girl's fantasy of what awaits her after she graduates high school. I'm actually embarrassed for the writers and embarrassed to be watching this show in my early 30s. At least the twenty-something characters on Friends acted like adults with real careers.,Which brings me to Ted, who is perhaps the most annoying main character in modern sitcom history. I can't stand him! What twenty-something male spends all of his time obsessing about getting married -- especially when he hasn't even met Ms. Right yet??? And surprise, all the women on the show are attracted to him, like he's Brad Pitt. In fact, all the girls in the bar look like models and are one-dimensional air-heads who ALWAYS instantly fall for our overly-nice drip of a main character.,Barney: ""Have you met Ted?"" Perfect-ten female with googly eyes *falling all over herself*: ""Hiiiii Ted!"" ,Speaking of annoying, the limo/cab driver with his stupid fruity smile and ""Helloooooooo!"" catch-phrase makes me want to join a fight club. Apparently there's only one cab driver in this juvenile fantasy version of New York city.,Add to this the endless flash-backs-within-flash-backs, and you've got the most pretentious recycled garbage that ever survived a pilot episode. Make no mistake, this ""romantic"" (read cornball) comedy may have fooled some of the less mature viewing audience -- those who are too young to have seen good comedy -- but this will NOT stand the test of time. I hope the writers and producers are enjoying the money while it lasts. I sure as heck will avoid any turkey their names are attached to from now on.,In closing, if you're checking this show out for the first time, I recommend watching the episode ""Dowisetrepla"" with all of its ""is what I should have said"" and it's ""is what I did say."" If you find that hilarious, then this show is definitely for you. Enough said.",How I Met Your Mother,1
Not sure why everyone is hating on this film???,"I thought this was a hilarious movie and I was pleasantly surprised at the positive energy the characters had and there were some good twists. People who are hating this movie must be pretty close minded because I laughed out loud quite a bit. If you had a fun college/party experience in your past and have a great, fun mom, you will see the humor in it. Sure, it's your average comedy/college movie but I thought it was great! Would recommend seeing it as a mom/daughter experience but my boyfriend loved it too. Also, Maya Rudolph is amazing as always.",Life of the Party,7
Refreshing,"When I saw the movie trailer I was not really impressed, but a friend of mine dragged me to see it, because she is a huge Melissa Mccarthy fan. And thank god she did! I have not seen a good comedy in a while and Life at the Party definitely made me laugh. All people in the cinema room were laughing as well! Amusing movie, which I would definitely recommend if you haven't seen a decent comedy recently and you want something refreshing.",Life of the Party,8
One of TV's Best Written Sitcoms,"I have seen a few episodes of the new CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory and to me it's one of the best written sitcoms currently on network TV. The scripts are filled with scientific references some people might not understand but they are very witty. Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons are definitely one of TV's newest comedy teams who have great chemistry and the addition of Kaley Cuoco as their neighbor, Penny brightens up the show. Let's not overlook the supporting cast with Simon Helberg as Wolowitz, who looks a little like Paul Reubens, the man behind Pee-Wee Herman and Kunal Nayyar as their friend from India. ,If you watch the closing credits closely, you'll notice that there's a credit saying ""Science Consultant."" It's the first sitcom to employ one. It was a very good idea by the show's creator Chuck Lorre, who also is behind the CBS hit Two and a Half Men to hire one to bring scientific honesty into the show. ,I hope The Big Bang Theory is around for several years. It has a solid future.",The Big Bang Theory,
Overrated is an Understatement,"After hearing all my (former) friends rant and rave about this ""smart, edgy, hilarious comedy"" that I just NEEDED to check out, I decided to give this show a try. Note that this is shortly after marathon-ing through some great TV shows like Breaking Bad which is actually a smart show. Anyway, 10 minutes into the first episode I was bored out of my skull with the already repetitive and awkward humour. But, I knew that 10 minutes of one episode was not enough to judge a show by. So I watched the 1st season and a half and I can say not once through those 25 episodes did I even come close to cracking anything that even slightly resembled half a smile. It is the same sitcom show we've seen for the past 40 years disguised as a quirky show filled with intelligent characters. I've read a lot of the other reviews on here and a lot of them agree with the statement that this is not a quirky or even slightly smart show. The demographic it appeals to are brain-dead teenagers who think that when the extremely unfunny Jim Parsons says a few big words, it is the most hilarious thing there has ever been. Strip away the incredibly simple Star Wars references and the mumbled soliloquies of Parsons and what's revealed is a below average sitcom decades behind its time filled with unlikable characters. It baffles me how people can enjoy a single episode of this nonsense, never mind call it a ""masterpiece"". Use the term ""comedy"" very loosely when describing this trash.",The Big Bang Theory,1
Don't waste your time on this,"I thought this is a popular series, it must be at least good not expecting this to be awesome.... but after watching orange is the new black, I lost my faith in TV series..Piper chapman the lead of this TV series is so much confused, or the writer of orange is the new black is confused about piper... she don't know what she is up to, she is just lost... so much unnecessary lesbian drama is shown.. I really regret the time I have wasted on Orange is the new black... first season was at least fine...but from second season it was awful... no direction of the plot.. unnecessary characters, unnecessary stories for unnecessary characters...",Orange Is the New Black,1
Disappointing!,"What happened to Season 3? It lost it's depth! Even Piper has been reduced to vapidity. Episode after episode, I keep hoping it'll get better but there is nothing but shallow characters and story lines. Even the flashbacks, which is basically half of the episode, don't really contribute anything to augment or improve the story. It appears to simply be fillers to just come up with a 55 minute episode. I loved Seasons 1 and 2, and was really looking forward to Season 3. Unfortunately, I find myself bored with every single episode of this season. Even Taylor Schilling, who did commendable acting in the previous seasons, appears to be high on something, in season 3.,Sad!",Orange Is the New Black,3
Cringeworthy 3d season,"***SPOILERS***,Let's face it, OITNB was never a perfect show, but seasons 1 and 2 had just enough good acting and good laughs in them to make up for the soppy melodramatic stuff. I wasn't psyched to see the third season, but I was sort of looking forward to it. My wife and I saw the whole thing and afterwards we agreed:,Season three is an absolute cringe-worthy mess. It's so bad I don't know where to begin. No wait, I do: ,And to top things off:,Of course there will be another season but I sure won't be watching that after having endured this pile of dung.",Orange Is the New Black,1
They're milking it,"I am extremely disappointed. I used to love this show when it first came out. And for the first 5 seasons I really did have a great time watching. I didn't necessarily laugh hysterically all the time, but it def. got a few laughs out of me. Everyone was in love with the characters, in love with the set up, in love with the story and the idea. ,I think the strongest selling point for this show was the name. ""How I met your mother"" was clever because it was new. It's kind of a weird title. a bit bizarre so people wanted to know more. Obviously after watching a few episodes you get the jest of it and you start to see how it's just future Ted Mosby talking to his kids narrating the supposed story of how he met their mother. ,Right, all good. Now we go through different ups and downs in Ted's life and we learn about the different characters which were constructed beautifully and I believe nailed by every single one of the actors. The problem lies with the show producers milking it to make more money. ,The story is pretty much done. Ted dated every kind of girl he possibly could. Almost got married god knows how many times. Once actually came close to it but got left at the altar. ,The show is simply not that funny anymore. It's starting to be pathetic really, as they desperately drag it much longer than it needs to. It's time to end it and move on.",How I Met Your Mother,6
Become so Boring,"This show was one of the best once it starts till almost season 6, and I wish they end it there.,It becomes so boring, they don't concentrate on the story anymore, a lot of (garbage if I can say that) just to fill the timing of the episodes. Especially this last season it screws everything, I watch complete episode, not even with one smile.,Anyway, if you want to watch this series, you're going to forward a lot while playing after season 5 or 6 (boring alert :),Comparing to TBBT show, I believe TBBT still holding to number 1 for me and How I met your mother lost it's flavor big time.",How I Met Your Mother,1

Loved it!!!,I laughed my butt off throughout the movie!! It's NOT a copycat of Back To School! The stories are very different. I actually liked this better than BtS with Rodney Dangerfield. It's definitely a girl power movie. I will be buying this when it's on DVD.,Life of the Party,7
"Typical, formulatic Comedy","Last year my friend just couldn't stop talking about how hilarious and funny this was. Even some of my teachers had said good things about it. My friend showed me two episodes on his laptop and said, "" If you don't think this is funny, I don't know what it"". Through the entire hour I laughed as many times as you've spoken while reading this review,zero. It still amazes me that hilarious shows such as Arrested Development get cancelled and this stays on air. For those who say this is "" Smart Comedy"" how is this funny when every funny thing in this show is easy for even the most idiotic people to understand. Than in Arrested Development you can watch episodes over and over again and still find new bits of comedy that you hadn't seen before. Than back to this show where people claim the funniest thing is Sheldon dressed like a zebra making weird noises. What's so smart about that?,The worst thing about this show is the Laugh Track. Now I don't mind laugh tracks if the show is funny but the laugh track just pops up at random places. A character will say something like, "" I want to be a robot."" Than the laugh track kicks off, sounding like they just heard the funniest thing in the world. The whole series are based on socially awkward nerds who meet a normal girl and they try uselessly to fit in with society. How can an entire 5 seasons be focused on that? One person commented saying in 5 minutes of Arrested Development they get more laughs than they get in a season of Big Bang. I disagree, I think in 5 minutes of Arrested Development I get more laughs than I get in the entire series.",The Big Bang Theory,1
Best show I've seen in a long time,"I just love this show! If you can appreciate great writing and great acting than this show is for you.,My favorite episode is ""The Big Bran Hypothesis"". That was hilarious. I hadn't laughed like that in a long time. When Leonard came out of his room in his underwear armed with a light-saber, I thought I was going to hurt myself I was laughing so hard. And the whole ""sarcasm"" bit was perfect comedy genius. And it's not just that the comedy is written so well - - the timing is dead on! The actors are truly artists.,Bravo CBS! I'm hooked and will keep watching!,And if anyone reading hasn't seen the show yet, check it out!",The Big Bang Theory,10
What Happened to This Show?,"I was a fan of this show when it started and into the second season. I just finished the third season and I can not believe it is getting such high reviews. I am not sure what happened in this season. I feel like the writers phoned this in. There was no story, just focus on each prisoner's little stories that made a huge effort for watchers to believe that the system is the real criminal and that the prisoners are all just victims. The show isn't even about Piper anymore, her storyline was so weak and boring. The relationship with her and Alex was dull. I couldn't wait for their scenes to end. The only potential storyline was what was going to happen to Alex and they just squeezed in a stupid ending that I guess was supposed to be a cliffhanger.,I am not real sure what this show is about anymore. At the end of episodes in the first two seasons you wanted to watch the next one to see what was going to happen next but not this time. NOTHING HAPPENED! There is no main character, I could really just care less about anything going on. It was painful to watch every episode. The only thing that kept me going was the possibility that the new girl Piper is working with was going to kill Alex. Sounds morbid I know but it would have at least been an interesting twist. Instead we got a super random and weird wedding, and hard to watch prisoner inmate relationships.",Orange Is the New Black,1
Too many stereotypes,"This could have been a really good show if the writers had actually taken the time to do some research on blacks and latinos, instead of relying on stereotypes that are found on the internet. I realize that when it comes to the white inmates on the show there's a good variety of characters. You have the meth addicts, and the hillbilly and the trailer trash, and the naïve blond haired blue eyed princess, oh and there's even a nun. OK that's great, there's plenty of diversity there.,Unfortunately the black cast is comprised of nothing but loud, ghetto, uneducated and obese women. The only two who seem normal are a transsexual and an emotional disturbed inmate dubbed crazy eyes, because in the eyes of the creators of the show a black woman must be a freak in order for her to possess some intelligence. The latina characters didn't turn out any better. Their characters were all written to be women with multiple children by multiple men, oh yeah and big surprise there is a mother and daughter in prison together. So freaking stereotypical that it's embarrassing. This show could have been so much better",Orange Is the New Black,5
Shock factors should never be deliberate,"The one star is for some of the characters in this, it is no doubt full of talented actors and actresses but I find a lot of the sex, nudity in this series is put in there deliberately for shock factor and it overtakes from any substantial story line. Unlike Breaking Bad, this is not a dark comedy that is effective in combining profound serious issues with humour. It fails at this remarkably in my opinion. I have watched other incredible films that revolve or have a central focal point around homosexuality - like Brokeback Mountain and Monster - these films do not come across as trying too hard to be eclectic because there's a holistic component to the entire story and its depth. They simply just tell the story and the story stands for itself. I guess what I mean is that it is pretty obvious to a viewer when nudity and sex scenes (be they same sex or not) are trying too hard to be shocking or eclectic to increase viewer ship and it gets in the way of the story. It's just trying to be too funny, too different and too deliberate with trying to appeal to men's girl on girl fantasies that the story loses substance.",Orange Is the New Black,1

What has happened to this series ??!!??,"There was a time when i considered HIMYM as the best ever sitcom..even above friends..but season 7 and now season 8 have proved to be great disappointments. After the dismal season 7 I was hoping the worst was over but here we are in season 8 and things don't seem to be improving. Few things that i have noticed: 1. Most of the stories are in flashback (so that makes the show flashback-in-flashback) 2. Stories have become more and more distant from reality and hence any attempt to induce laughter seems superficial. 3. Characters seem old and droopy. 4. Setup seems overcrowded and overstuffed, specially Lily and Marshall's apartment. It is kinda irritating. What exactly is happening to HIMYM?

I guess if 50 years olds sleeping with kids that turn out to be their ex husbands new wive's son, is inspirational to you... than have at it.,This movie is so incredibly stupid and unfunny that I actually felt shameful that I dedicated the time and effort to sitting all the way through it. ,Thanks movie pass, for lowering my standards so bad that I'll virtually sit through anything now to find a reason to have theater popcorn on a day off... ,Good lord... avoid this turd. It's awful.",Life of the Party,2
A few very funny parts,"This is a cute movie with several good laughs. There were a few funny ""very adult female"" lines that had the over 40 women laughing hysterically. ,My only issue with the film (and I feel this way about any film portraying graduations) is that those getting a bachelors degree (or h.s. diploma for that matter) would not be HOODED. That is reserved for Masters and doctoral degrees. I wish Hollywood would get that right.",Life of the Party,8
WAY Funnier than I expected!!!,"I got dragged to this movie because my wife wanted to see it. I went in with low expectations based on the reviews here, don't listen to them. This movie was definitely funny. It is your classic Melissa McCarthy movie, lots of physical comedy; but also a typical sorority/frat college movie minus nudity. Reminded me of back to school meets house bunny meets Melissa McCarthy. It tried too hard for laughs at some points but most McCarthy comedies do. Definitely worth the watch I was expecting sitting for 2 hours hating life, as most movies my wife wants to see usually are, but this was actually pretty damn funny.",Life of the Party,7
"Not a big bang, but bang enough","It's the new ""Friends"" alright. Not less cheesy, but at times even funnier. I'm from the generation that grew up with ""Friends"", but I would vote for the millennials. I feel a bit nostalgic for the 1980's sometimes, but I also understand and appreciate the jokes from the ""new kids in town"". It's pure fun, no more, no less. It has its flaws, but it has its wits too. It's a medicine for foul moods, depression, and loneliness. And as such, I believe it deserves at least 8 out of 10.",The Big Bang Theory,8
"One of the most overrated, dull TV shows i have ever seen..","I heard so many good things about Orange is the New Black and the plot made it seem like it would be interesting so i decided to give it a try....I can now say i have officially wasted hours of my life watching one of the most uneventful, overrated, unrealistic and just plain boring shows on television ,Orange is the New Black is a completely unrealistic portrayal of a woman's prison and the drama's that go on inside it. First of all, it paints prison like somewhat of a sorority, there are no gangs/factions, an extremely low level of illegal activity, very soft violence (if any) and all of the inmates seem to be each other's best friends. I also don't appreciate the fact that every inmate seems to be in prison for a reason that is not of her own wrongdoing, like ALL of them are victims of the justice system and have been hard-done by in their life.,I literally watched episode after episode where NOTHING happened, there is an episode at the beginning of the show, centered around the main character Paige, imagining she is seeing a chicken....i was honestly waiting for some kind of amazing cliffhanger or plot twist in this episode....but the entire episode was about a chicken ,I have never been a fan of long, overly drawn out weak character progressions, and that's exactly what tho show is. It has a bleak and unrealistic storyline, characters who are so predictable and incredibly dull that they are honestly hard to distinguish from each other, and absolutely NO significant plot twists, cliff-hangers or interesting story lines....,If you want to watch a boring, over-hyped, lesbian sorority then watch this show.....if you want something WAY better...then watch Orphan Black",Orange Is the New Black,2
awful not even worth watching,"If you want to see something unpredictable from the first episode. Well go watch Breaking Bad cause the main plot sucks. Everything that Piper wants she gets. She never has any bad news. It would make more sense if her fiancé, who fought the urge to cheat, cheated on her. From the first episode you realize shes going to get back with her ex Alex. I was really hoping this was going to be a good series and has a ton of potential and they just flush it down the drain. I wouldn't have seen it coming if she backed away from Alex cause she didn't want to be in the hole again, or if she realized that her fiancé was the right guy. Its a lesbian feminist show that holds no real plot twist. I mean the side stories are more interesting then the main one.",Orange Is the New Black,1
Very good show from the creator of weeds,"Jenji Cohan does it again. This show covers the life of an innocent minded girl going through the troubles of fitting in to one of the worst places to be, prison. Throughout her sentence she learns the do's and don't's. she finds living her suburban lifestyle wont work. just like our favorite drug dealing mom, Nancy Botwin, she learns quickly and not always efficiently. It does a great job of entertaining through laughs and a few cries. Great casting and writing. If you enjoyed weeds then I highly recommend watching this. The best (or worst) part is that you can watch all 13 episodes whenever you want if you're subscribed to Netflix instant. I can almost guarantee you will fall in love with piper Chapman. You will laugh and cry with her as she tries to make it through her sentence.",Orange Is the New Black,10
Totally lost after season 5,"At the beginning this show WAS really entertaining, funny, good jokes and everything was in place. But it turned out like bad friends. I guess they decided to prolong finding ""Mother"" just because of popularity. Everybody sleeps with everybody and that's normal and they are ""friends"" after all no matter they slept each other. Seems like only Marshall and Lilly are normal in this. I really hated when Ted decided to leave Victoria because of Robin. Should we abandon our partners because of dumb friends? So immature.,Also, forced jokes in last two seasons (7/8) are so bad I won't watch this anymore, just the last episode to see who that perfect women is. Shame, it had potential but failed HARD!",How I Met Your Mother,4
OK comedy with some overcooked moments,"As daughter Maddie enters her final year at university, mum Deanna is brutally dumped by her husband, and so decides to return to university to complete the degree she gave up to have Maddie. Maddie is not amused.,Written by Melissa McCarthy and her husband (who directs it), this comedy treads fairly familiar ground. It's not unfunny (though nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is), and has an identifiable emotional core. ,I found the suggestion that hot student Jack (who looks like a cross between Harry Potter if he was normal height, and Jake Gyllenhaal) would become sexually besotted by short, portly forty-something Deanna strained my credibility somewhat, but it worked fairly well as a comedy dynamic.,The final fund-raising payoff was also a tad unconvincing, but never mind.,This is a time-passer, nothing more.",Life of the Party,7
Rodney Dangerfield would be disappointed,"The movie is alright and will help waste time if you need to. McCarthy performs decently, not her best work but not her worst. The main issue is that the movie is too similar to Back to School with Rodney Dangerfield.",Life of the Party,4

Bad Series,"I have no clue who all liked this series. Its slow, boring, badly written, poor performances by mostly all characters. There are many good TV shows out there, this is definitely 1/10 rating I could not watch past 7 episodes of season 1 That too, I was forcing myself. It does not flow well and it tests your patience. I feel all those who have given it a thumbs up are not exposed to better cinema Its time people come up with honest ratings and reviews. Gosh, I hope the producers realize their mistake and don't make season 2 the choice of characters is bad, the plot is boring unlike other series where u cant wait to watch the next episode, this one bores the living guts out of you in an episode. Please please stop this torture",Orange Is the New Black,1
Should have bowed out with season 4,"I watched every episode of seasons 1 to 4 of OITNB during a bit of a marathon box set run last year. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was really looking forward to season 5 - but what a disappointment! I watched up to episode 4 last night and that's it for me I'm afraid! The season begins with a prison riot and by episode 4 it's still going on with no hint of authorities taking any action! There is no story line - just a mish mash of barely connected 'happenings' that are so ridiculous that they are not even funny (the 'hand in the pocket gun', the half naked guards in captivity, the talent show, 'Red' acting like a 5 year old on a sugar high and absolutely no screen time for Piper and Alex). The only light on the horizon was Uzo Aduba as Crazy Eyes - she was outstanding as always. Sorry folks, but I think this has run it's course.",Orange Is the New Black,1
So highly overrated!,"Well, how to put it? Tastes are subjective but I really cannot imagine how somebody can give this show a 10, or even a 6! Someone compared this to Friends... well, it could be if it had humor, something that Friend had in abundance and sorely lacks in this one.,I just really cannot cope with the fact that so many worthy shows struggle to get renewed or are outright canceled (Firefly to name the first that comes to my mind) and such garbage is now at what, the 9th season? I do like the actors, I'm a big fan of Neal Patrick Harris and Jason Segel, I really am. But they're only able to raise this show from its abysmal depths of crappiness to a level of utter mediocrity.,I'll go re-watch Friends or even Joey for some real laughs, or Community if I want something more recent, How I Met You Mother is not worth the time spent to write this.",How I Met Your Mother,3
Worst comedy I ever followed,"How can I say it respectfully? hmm.... It's disgustingly boring and insultingly illogical.,I admit that season 1 and 2 were extremely well made. Maybe it is the reason why I am now extremely disappointed. The writers only uses tricks of ""sudden turns of events"" to generate funny moments. Having watched many episodes of this show, all I see is that characters constantly changing their beliefs, decisions, and actions back and forth without any logical reasons: we two must break up, no, we must get back together, no, that's just impulse, we should still break up, no, that's true love, we must get back together, no, it's true love because we wanted it to be, we should break up...... ,The show is not making too much sense now. The five figures in the show don't have consistent characters any more. You can not ask such questions: ""how could this person possibly do such a thing?"" Because you won't have any logical answers. Maybe this is exactly what American shows are about: like fast food, you don't need to enjoy it, just swallow what is given to you. Sometimes, you stop and think ""wait a minute, this doesn't make sense, doesn't XX just did something exactly the opposite a minute ago?"" No, you can't. The writers just throw to you another contradictory joke and you are moving on.,I feel deeply insulted watching the show. I feel that the writers assume that audience never think deeper than the superficial meaning of the jokes while watching shows, which is not true.,Deeply disappointed.",How I Met Your Mother,1
Haters... Haters Everywhere.,"No, this movie was not extraordinary. But dang people have so much hate inside them. It wasn't a strong story, but I laughed out loud a good handful of times.

"Wafer thin characters, dire plot, very disappointing","I started watching Orange is the New Black with my girlfriend a few months ago and I tolerate it for the sake of having a programme that we both watch and discuss. When the third series ended and we waited for the fourth, I binge watched Weeds, not realising at the time that there was any connection but just about everything I found wrong with Oranges is the New Black applied to Weeds as well.,At the outset, I found the premise quite interesting but somewhat distant from what the hype had led me to expect. I had, for some reason, expected a gritty, perhaps brutal, examination of life in a women's prison. I didn't expect a consommé thin factory produced programme with the depth of the average soap opera. I hung in there hoping that the characters would engage me but they did not develop. The plot was as interesting as watching a marble roll around a maze. My girlfriend and I hardly spoke about episodes after we watched them, which was unusual. We just plodded on. And on. And so on.,After one episode, my girlfriend asked me which character was my favourite and rather than being able to say, in an instant, the name of somebody I cared about, I thought for quite some time going through every character I could remember and could not think of one about whom I gave a damn.,The reason is simple, there are no characters in this series. Sure, there are names in the script who have lines but none of them are consistent. They are shapeless vessels from which lines are delivered. I felt sorry for the actors having, say, to be stupid in one scene and articulate in another. They weren't even two dimensional - they were nebulous and without the actor's face, would have been unrecognisable from scene to scene.,Only after the end of the third series did my girlfriend and I really talk about it and both agreed that the writing was awful and the whole thing lacked any texture. Nonetheless, we are watching the fourth series, ore out of habit than interest, and it just gets worse. Now the plot has taken over as the worst flaw. I hesitate to use the expression, 'jumped the shark' but having an inmate stand on a dining table for days on end without food or drink stretches all kinds of real world precepts. And following the discovery of the body in the garden, I very much doubt that it would be in the jurisdiction of the guards to carry out the investigation.,I suppose it is possible that we are expected to believe that Lichfield has gone rogue but everything looks too wobbly to be believable. With just a few more cackly lewd gags and a guard stepping on an inmate's towel, this could pass as an American Carry On Cellmate.,{UPDATE},Having just watched the last two episodes of Series 4, it occurred to me that had the programme opened at that point, it may have met my expectation to a greater degree. But everything is still too clean.",Orange Is the New Black,2
1 - 5,"What started out as a number one has been downsized to a number 5 season 4.. Have not seen the whole season as yet, but the first four episodes are not nearly as good as past seasons, hence the rating to number 5 One major plot hole (spoiler alert) is : Doesn't anyone miss the guard who was murdered??? Thus far, NOTHING. Doesn't anyone on the staff or his private life wonder what happened to him? What about his paycheck. What does anyone think when he just 'vanishes' and doesn't even pick up his check!!!! Unless this is addressed later in the season, I will give this an even lower rating as the season progresses... Some of the backstories are not very interesting and just take up room as what's going on inside the prison. Wish the writers, producers or even some cast members would pick up on this and especially WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT HIT-MAN GUARD!!!!!! Nuff' said except some of the acting is very good to poor....will not name names!!!",Orange Is the New Black,5
Good for 4 or 5 seasons then it falls flat for years,"Others have weighed in on this very popular show by the thousands. I'm coming to this through my wife's Netflix binge watching. And for the record I know how it ends, haven't seen it, don't care. So many people complained about that but what they don't get is that it doesn't matter. Everyone knows how it ends after S1E3. Or they should. It's a freakin sitcom. It's going to be 100% predictable. Not bad predictable just predictable. For the first 4 or 5 seasons it's OK. After that though it's just annoying predictable. They're people in their late 20s early 30s who act like 18 and again that's fine until it gets super super old. How many years can you string along a shaggy dog story about whiny dysfunctional narcissists? 6 years? 7? 8? Nope. 9 long long long seasons of the same old old old same old.

This show doesn't make you laugh that much.,"I was told that if you like Friends, you'll like How I met your mother. The show is now on Netflix, so I thought: ""Why not."" I have no idea how this show has been so popular and I'm wondering why on Earth people compare this to the epic comedy: Friends. very boring. And to be honest, I didn't feel it had a cohesive storyline, and the people or the story didn't seem to get anywhere. Just a bunch of separate ""jokes"" and moments. I wasn't excited about the ending of the first season and didn't even realize, when Netflix started to roll the second season. To me it felt the same all the time...And the characters just seem to lack personality.,What bothers me the most, is that the jokes and characters have so much similar things as Friends. Every time something familiar came up, I was so annoyed and thought that couldn't the writers really come up with something different and original. Too many times I kept thinking ""I have seen this"" and ""Are you kidding me, you stole that from Friends"".,Just to name a few...,*One thing that annoyed me the most, was that nobody quite knew what Barney's job was and that was one of the main things of Chandler's character. Seriously, the writes should have NOT used that joke here!,*The others are calling Barney Swarley, and he hates it. In Friends Chandler wanted to be Clint, but everyone kept calling him Gene. Barney's and Chandler's reactions are very similar. ,*Marshall and Jill (the ""main couple"") want to get married in Casino. So did Monica and Chandler. *Barney is womanizer, so is Joey.

It's not Melissa's fault that this film is not great,"I really love Melissa McCarthy. Yes, she is the funniest woman in Hollywood with good acting skills.

It is almost as though a team of writers have come together to think up the most obvious, in your face, situations and have then proceeded script them.

Watch season 1-3 and just read the rest online,"When I first started watching How I met your mother I felt it had the potential to be a new Friends. It was funny, the characters were lovable, interesting, and had personality. The story was quite engaging and this is how it went for 3 seasons. Then the show got stuck. The main plot just goes in circles and all side plots, which could have been really interesting on their own, just get lost among fillers and boring moments that make you wish you'd stop watching the show. That's what I eventually did around season 7, and I only regret not have taking that decision earlier. I did feel tempted to go back to it for the last season, but I decided not to. From what I learned afterwards about the ending of the whole show and how the plot developed, I definitely don't regret my decision. The only thing I regret was season 5 and 6. Wish I had stopped back in the 4th, when I realised the show was going nowhere or even better at the end of season 3 (peak of the show).",How I Met Your Mother,6
Again?,"So Hollywood has really run out of ideas. This is such a worn out storyline. Melissa McCarthy looked to be a break out player, but then does this crap.

"Painful to watch (how bad it is), and then moments later it's hilarious again.","'LIFE OF THE PARTY': Three Stars (Out of Five),A comedy about a recently divorced mother who decides to go back to college, and then ends up in her daughter's class (much to her daughter's disappointment). It stars Melissa McCarthy, Molly Gordon, Gillian Jacobs, Maya Rudolph, Julie Bowen, Matt Walsh, Stephen Root and Jacki Weaver. The film was directed by Ben Falcone (who also directed his wife, Melissa McCarthy, in the comedy hits 'TAMMY' and 'THE BOSS'), and it was written by the married couple. The movie has received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it is expected to be yet another hit at the Box Office for McCarthy and Falcone. I found it to be really uneven, and hit-and-miss with laughs. ,As Maddie Miles (Gordon) goes off to college, her father, Dan (Walsh), tells her mother, Deanna (McCarthy), that he wants a divorce. Heartbroken, Deanna decides she wants to go back to college, since she quit school a year before graduation (when she became pregnant with Maddie). By going back to school Deanna feels liberated for the first time in her life, and she begins partying with Maddie's friends and sleeping with a college student half her age. She of course finds happiness, and her true self in the process.,The film is really funny in places, and then not funny at all in other places. At times it's even painful to watch (how bad it is), and then moments later it's hilarious again. I've seen a lot of comedies like this, and of course they're hard to overly recommend, or discourage people from seeing. It's definitely good for at least some good laughs, and it's a feel good/positive movie too. It's not as good as 'TAMMY', or McCarthy's best films definitely though.",Life of the Party,6
Life of the Party (2018),"I thought Tammy and The Boss (both directed by Melissa McCarthy's real life husband, Ben Falcone) were both terrible. Not really a fan of the Ben Falcone or Melissa McCarthy collaborations, as it just brings unfunny movies that don't entertain. Third time was meant to be the charm but I had my doubts that this film would be any fun. Life of the Party isn't great, but its actually a lot better than I expected.,The film is about a recently divorced mother who realizes that she wants to go back to her college and finish getting her degree in archaeology. It just so happens that her daughter also currently attends, so the mom becomes friends with her daughters friends. Along the way she finds a romance with a college aged student and also finds ways to enjoy herself and try out things that she hasn't before.,The audience in my theater ate up this film and thought everything was funny. There aren't that many laugh out loud moments but I did find the humor to work at some times whereas the other previous Falcone films were devoid of any. McCarthy can come off as grating an loud but I thought she was fine in this film. The film overall goes for a real feel good element, which is fine. Its lighthearted and still safe. It has many common elements of the sorority/frat college type film and you can expect to see a lot of the same here.,This film was something to pass the time. Its not something to go back to or really think about. I thought the supporting characters (Maya Rudolph and Heidi Gardner) really add to the humor of the film. Thought the daughter's boyfriend was a completely disposable character that had virtually no impact in any of the plot. There's definite flaws in this but at the moment I'm just glad I didn't have a horribly unbearable time.,6/10",Life of the Party,6
Comparisons,"I'm from Scotland and loved the British ""Office"". But I adore the American version! Steve Carell leads a great cast and I'm not surprised it has lasted so long. I'm working my way through Series 3 and have series 4 and 5 to look forward to. It's amazing how much the writers can get into 20 minutes. I like it when there is a double episode. I too am so glad there is no laughter track (which has stopped me watching quite a few comedy shows). I have noticed in this third series that the camera can be very annoying when it whizzes from character to character - far too quickly. Completely unnecessary. Steve's ""Michael"" conveys so much about the character - he's full of himself but so vulnerable and anxious for friends. Rainn Wilson's ""Dwight"" is just brilliant. And I love the company name - ""Dunder Mifflin""!",The Office,10
well what can i say really!!,"This show really is outstanding, in fact its the only show i think i can rate as a 10. ,From watching the original uk series back in 2001 on bbc TV, i never thought an American remake would stand any ground whatsoever. When the first series aired in the uk it did'nt really make its mark, and unfortunately never caught on. I was disappointed when it disappeared from our screens, and then quickly forgot about it. I thought it had 1 series and crashed and burned. Then one day i was checking out the reviews for evan almighty on IMDb and noticed that steve carel had still been making this show. I had to get hold of it and see it, And to my joy there was 5 series waiting for me. I never get into TV like i have done with this, i ended up watching 10 episodes in a day, i think i did all 5 series in just under 2 weeks. This show is funny, its acted brilliantly, its over the top, totally crazy but totally entertaining. If your ever down just bung on a couple episodes from good old dunder miflin in scranton and you cant go wrong. ,Gervais said that 2 series of the office in the uk was enough. And that he did'nt want to take it further. I know he helps on the US version, and i sure he is surprised to see 6 series already of what i can only describe as the best American sitcom of all time!!",The Office,10
Surpasses the brilliant original.,"After reading all of the horrible reviews coming from the UK, I felt the strong desire to comment. I learned that most of the reviewers bashing it have only seen a few (at most) episodes from the first season - many haven't seen it at all, and are simply bashing it because of an overwhelming sense of pride in the original. I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. ,This whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty. The casts of the US and UK versions love each show. Ricky Gervais even wrote and executive produced a few episodes of the US version. Open your minds, people! Most of the US fans KNOW that it's based on a British version. It has gotten the credit it deserves for being a brilliant and hilarious show. ,But the American version is also brilliant and hilarious. I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version. ,I've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable. ,As for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with. ,This is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much. These three shows get better with each viewing and are great because there's so many levels of humor, from the apparent outrageousness to the minute details that are noticed after repeated viewings and are often funnier than the surface material.",The Office,7
They made the impossible,"I watched the British version of The Office and became a fan - as almost everyone. So I decided to see if the American version was as good as the original. A doubt feeling emerged at the first episode, since I still was with the original - and awesome - characters in mind. They were not just funny, but peculiar, inimitable. I didn't let this impression ruin my experience, though. Gladly. The American version is obviously inspired in the British version, but they are not the same. Simple like this. The American characters are not mere counterparts of David, Tim, Gareth, Dawn... They are hole new versions of the kind of people we can easily find in any office. And equally inspired versions of these workers. Since I've lost several episodes when they aired for the first time, I'm now at the third season, and I will surely see all the episodes through the end. More than one time...",The Office,10
Mindblowing,"I only started seeing this series on this year and i'm on the 6th season already. on the first season i couldn't understand how this could be a good series, the actors were charismatic and the acting were very good but there was almost no story that i could follow and Michael seemed like a very hateable person. on the second season things started to pick up a bit but nothing so special. from the third season to the sixth i got completely hooked because after all there is a story to follow, a very interesting one, and Michael is in fact a genius and that is more evident on the fifth and sixth seasons. if someone believes that Michael does something that goes against the objectives that he has inside the company (even if a lot of times it seems that he does), i'm sure that that person isn't really understanding what's the main philosophy behind Michael's character. it took me 3 seasons to understand Michael Scott and it was because of that, that i didn't liked the series very much, after that, i loved it, and it's my favorite series now. When you do understand all the characters, besides being very entertaining and delightful to watch, it is going to blow your mind sometimes.",The Office,10
"Not as bad as I thought it would be, but...","When I found out that they were making an American version of The Office, one of the most heart-stoppingly good situation comedies, I thought, ""Why?"" I thought that it would be simply awful, like many Americanised shows. I found a link for the Myspace pilot. I started it, and it actually wasn't too bad. It really wasn't. I really enjoyed it. It was really good. One of the funniest bits was where Mr. Brown got the little card that said ""black"" (I won't go further than that, and the show didn't go too far into that anyways, but it was really funny just seeing that). To be honest, it was one of the most excellent Americanisations of a British shows. There were some great moments, like the east Indian woman coming back into the room and the boss going ""Hallo! Welcom to my stor! Vuld yu like sum gooki-gooki? Tri my gooki-gooki!"".,However, I felt much of the time that the characters were rather lifeless. You couldn't really feel for them. They weren't as deep or real as the original BBC characters, to whom you could relate even if you'd never been in an office. The boss just wasn't good enough for what the original set the bar as (the David Brent character going down in history as ""most annoying boss""), although he tries, really hard. One never really gets into Jim, who was originally Tim (good one, NBC). Pam (aka Dawn) isn't quite as well-played as Dawn's character. And the hideous syncophant (Gareth) has been replaced by a simply-annoying Dwight.,But what really makes the show a lifeless slug is the running time, which is barely twenty minutes. The whole thing seems far too rushed, and there just isn't enough material to satisfy the typical BBC-Office-watcher. The jokes aren't quite as good as the original, and there are so few of them. The pilot never really goes into anything, although the real show may prove different. However, a good feature in The Office is that NBC didn't spring for a laugh track, which would've ruined the show.,All in all, The Office is a feeble shadow of its British counterpart, but it still manages to please.",The Office,6
Humour is a funny thing . . .,"Admittedly I absolutely adore the UK version (got both seasons on DVD) so was intrigued to find out what the US were capable of and, as of yet, only got to see the first three episodes of the US version.,First the good points, the US version avoided the laughter track (which would have been the kiss of death) and still retained the dodgy camera-work (some people who hated this style seem to misunderstand that the comedy is supposed to reflect a fly-on-the-wall documentary and slick camera work is not a priority). At least, to some extent or other, the show retains some integrity to the original.,However, I think one of the differences of the two shows (comparing is inevitable sorry)is how human these characters are. They are clearly flawed characters trying to get through life which gives an understanding as to why they are who they are. See, in the UK version of The Office, despite the ego and the manipulation you can almost feel the amount of pain David Brent goes through in his effort to impress people and feel comfortable being himself in his own skin. We can see Gareth Keenan's social inability and how his botched attempts at frustrated flirting end up as sexual harassment, Dawn Tinsley's stoic long-suffering, unsatisfying love-life and unfulfilled ambitions and Tim Canterbury's lack of confidence and fear of change to push forward to try and better himself are all poignantly on show in very subtle ways.,The US version seemed to reduce itself to a set of stock characters. For example, Michael looks too conventional and his part is played too one-dimensionally for his role to work so he appears just stupid and nerdish rather than looking beyond the eager to please ego to find a man constantly seeking validation underneath the delusions of grandeur. Jim seemed far too cool and confident and in control of his surroundings to really endure the pangs of anxiety when office chaos occurs and Dwight just seems like a nasty piece of work as with Gareth you could tell he was overcompensating for his own insecurities. Yes, different shows perhaps but some things needed to stay the same for the humour to work. ,I also think the Pam/Jim romance was overdeveloped too soon. There didn't appear to be internal struggles going on between them so when they were to realise each other's feelings for each other the pay-off would be considerably smaller (in the first episode alone Pam was humorously embarrassed by Jim's ability to guess her favourite yoghurt flavour - corny at best, lol).,The fact that the US actors seem like they are acting badly rather than normal everyday people acting up in front of the camera doesn't go in it's favour either.,The UK version thrived on the fact that you were going to feel very uncomfortable watching the show, that was the genius behind it. The long protracted silences, the embarrassing events, the over-inflated egos getting their bubble's pricked time and time again all completely lost in the US version. The pace was also deliberately quickened too (probably to keep time with adverts) so hitting the pain barrier was kept to a minimum and therefore the effect was lost. It gives me the impression that the US producers were scared that if it got too uncomfortable to watch that the audience couldn't handle it and therefore would be turned off...a shame really.,All in all, at least the US are attempting to make a show that isn't frightened to deal with everyday average people in an everyday environment but it has a long way to go yet. I still can't decide whether we English overall are too sadistic as a nation or whether the Americans have accepted mawkish sentimentality as the norm but one thing for sure, this show in both versions displays how a situation can be interpreted in two entirely different ways by two totally different countries.",The Office,5
The Office- The Best,"I do not have a single negative thing to say about The Office. It is by far my favorite show. I eagerly await a new episode every week.,All the unique characters have depth and are well developed.,As to all the people who don't like it because its based on the U.K. version, get over it. It has been taken to a completely different level. The characters in a spin off are not supposed to stay the exact same, otherwise a spin off would be pointless.,The characters are constantly evolving, and they are never constantly the protagonist or antagonist, so they are all at some point endearing. The characters are wonderfully bizarre yet real.,If you don't find this show funny, then you need to get a funny bone. Writers, keep em coming.",The Office,10
A pleasant surprise....six years later.,"I am a huge fan of the British version of the Office. I remember looking forward to the American version when it first came out and being disappointed immediately to the point that I refused to watch it after the first episode. Almost 6 years later I gave it another go as people were telling me that it was actually quite good. I took the advice that I should start from season 2. This time around I enjoyed it more and gradually warmed to the characters that were basically copies of the British version. I can't believe that I would ever say this, but this show is as good as the British version. The bonus is that there is a lot more of it. It was certainly a knee-jerk reaction to give up on it so quickly, but it seems that a lot of people did. The Jim/Pam relationship is a clone of Tim and Dawn, but some of the pranks that they play on Dwight(Gareth in British version) are quite brilliant. There are certainly differences between the two versions, but generally the American version stays fairly true to the original.,If you loved the original, definitely give this a go.",The Office,9
Blasphemy! A Brit who likes this version as much as the original!,"As a fan of the original ""Office"" I was, of course, skeptical about the American remake. We have many shining beacons to shows that have bombed badly when transferred across the ocean. However, pinch me I must be dreaming, this version of the show is actually very good. I should also point out that I'm British and, as blasphemous as it might be to my fellow countrymen, I believe that the US version to be every bit as good as the original with excellent casting and smart writing throughout.,The first season was a little spotty, especially when translating the British show verbatim. However, once the writers came up with original story lines and situations the, American, office really took off. The second season was an incredible achievement and is just carrying on where it left off in the third season.,Steve Carell is well suited to the role of Micheal Scott, lending his character a certain pathetic quality that even Gervais's David Brent did not have at times. The supporting cast is equally as good, especially Rainn Wilson as the assistant (to the) general manager, Dwight Shrute. Wilson deserved, at least, an Emmy nomination for his troubles. ,If you dismiss the show out of hand then you will definitely be missing out on one of the best shows on TV right now.",The Office,9
"A Highly Unique, Original Series","With so many jobs taking place in office buildings, this television series that is based on the Ricky Gervais created BBC series, takes aim at that and other aspects of the modern American workplace. Steve Carrell leads a large cast of talented actors that succeed in creating a smart, silly comedy that works.,Carrell is Michael Scott, the dim-witted boss of paper company Dunder Mifflin's Scranton, Pennsylvania branch. Rainn Wilson is Scott's odd second in command Dwight Shrute, a man who prides himself on knowledge of survival techniques and bears. Jim Krasinski is Jim Halpert, a salesman who has a crush on Pam(Jenna Schafer), the receptionist. These are only a few of the major characters in the ongoing, hilarious saga of Scranton at work.,Several story lines can take place in the course of a single episode, giving the show more chances at laughs. In one episode, for example, there are conflicts between members of the Party Planning Committee, Michael's usual antics of procrastination, and the secrets of two characters's affair. These just make the show more original than ones that have a single narrative.,Funny and intelligent, The Office is one brilliant spoof you should not miss.",The Office,10
My Favorite TV Show,"This is not just a funny TV show, it's my favorite TV show. Steve Carell is awesome and super funny, Rainn Wilson too, Jonh Krasinsky is very good as an actor and Jenna Fisher has a very interesting character. If you watch just an episode, you might think the show is a bit boring, but if you watch five more episodes, you're going to love it, that's was exactly what happened to me, in every episode there's always something amazing, someone's birthday, a romance, a problem to be fixed but there is no episode that I don't laugh about something, this TV show is a fake documentary, what makes the show even more funny. There's a lot of good actors in this show and all the episodes are funny and entertaining, this is definitely my favorite TV show and by the way, watch Dwight (Rainn Wilson) fake crying in the episode that Jim (Jonh Krasinski) leaves.",The Office,10
British Haters,"Stop with the nonsense. This show is hilarious. If they used the same cast or facsimiles of them, it wouldn't be a remake. It would be the British version. I've seen both versions, and each has its own charm, style, and tense scenarios. Ricky Gervais, who created the series, is a co-producer and writes some episodes, which is ironic considering he took the biggest part in the first, three episodes (to get it off its feet) and they have been trashed the most.,It's clear that Steve C. (I don't want to butcher the spelling of his last name) either took tips from Ricky Gervais or studied his performance. They even readjust their tie the same way. Albeit, the first two seasons were a little weak as the show gained steam and attempted to match its predecessor, but that's no reason to shrug it off. From the third season onward, the ""American"" Office has come into its own with story lines that introduced new characters and shook the formula of a nerdy boy awkwardly pining for a pretty girl.,Every fan should be happy to have new episodes of a great show that would otherwise be off the air. For a true fan of the Office that should be enough, but since it's labeled ""American"" some immediately set out to find the wrong. Cheers to the people that were capable of giving the remake a chance and didn't base their opinion on what country it's filmed in. All I ask of those whom originally ripped the ""American"" version is to go online and watch the seasons with Ed Helms as Andy, a kiss-ass with anger management issues. The feud with Dwight and he (once the branches merge) has become my favorite storyline of the show, culminating in a duel. It's classic.",The Office,10
Give this a chance,"I haven't seen the British show upon which this is based, so I'm daring to judge this show by its own merits.,Boy, do I like it. This is the best mockumentary comedy since The Larry Sanders Show. Steve Carell is fantastic, and everything is wonderfully underplayed. I just worry that the show is too intelligent for American audiences, and won't last long as a result.,I'm hoping the network will foster this one like Fox has with Arrested Development, pushing it where it can, not expecting big audiences right off the bat, and allowing it to grow. I doubt if the show will grow beyond a cult hit, but hopefully that will be enough to keep it on the air for at least a few years.",The Office,10
My favourite sitcom EVER!!,"Honestly, I thought show as 'boring' even before I watched a single episode. Seriously, what interesting could happen in an office environment? I remember first scene I saw from this show. It was from an internet wallpaper with Michael Scott with a white board behind him saying ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"".,Then after years from that, I somehow started watching ""The Office"", I don't really remember why I did that. What I love most about this show is it's raw nature. The camera is kind of shaky yet still brings the best scenes...something that I had never seen before in a TV sitcom. It may seem less professional but adds real life, personal touch with the TV show and the characters in them.,Obviously, Michael Scott is one of my favourite character. Jim, Andy, Dwight, Pam, Erin, Kevin, Oscar, Angela, Creed and even the camera crew include in my favourite list.,What I learned from this show is that it's okay to be weird and different ,that you won't be welcomed as you wanted it to be ( remembering Michael Scott attempts ), that you can't wait and expect things to happen for you, that it's okay to be hated and feel hate to others....it's all dependent on time. People change, feelings change, situations change. All you got to do is be yourself and be true to your heart and everything will fall into it's place.,I love every minute I spent on this show <3",The Office,10
"In the end, I'm really glad I took the time to watch the series in its entirety...","For the past several months since I dropped my cable company and picked up Netflix I've been watching The Office. Practically everyday after work and after finishing what needed to be done I'd watch several episodes and have done so from start to finish. I have been captivated by every character and to watch their personalities develop I almost had to ask myself if this was really a TV series or a real documentary. Even though the characters were slightly dramatized, I had coworkers or friends that had similar traits to 'almost' all of them so that made it even more personal. Having just watched the last episode I was surprised on how sad I became to not be able to come home and see what new adventures the office was going to go through. The show was very captivating and really pulled you into their lives. I think the people that don't like the show probably didn't start from the beginning and only watched several episodes because, to be honest, after the first several episodes of the 1st season I was going to stop watching it but I'm glad I didn't.,Having watched a 9 year 'documentary' in several months really puts a perspective on life and just how short it is. Watching the last episode and seeing everyone's reaction to seeing each other again really hit home, and how you should appreciate the time you have because it goes by so fast. You could even see how the characters aged slightly over the years although the makeup probably made it seem less than it really was I would think.,In the end, I'm really glad I took the time to watch the series in its entirety...between the bouncing relationships, clever/brilliant pranks, it was all very enjoyable :)",The Office,10
"Never gets old, never will.","I'm going to go straight to the point, and say this is the most hilarious show I've ever seen. Michael's idiocy, and Jim's pranks on Dwight,and even Stanley's grumpiness is even hilarious! The show not only makes you laugh, there are some heartwarming moments, and there are some moments where you didn't see coming. And you know another way how 'The Office' is an fantastic show? The show was still good when Michael left! An huge part of The Office left, and it still was great! I've seen the ending of the office, and both times cried (And proudly so), because during the show, you fall in love with the characters, you relate to them. Basically, what I'm trying to say is, it's worth the 21 minutes.",The Office,10
Great as usual,"You cant compare UK version with US version. they are completely different. If you liked the UK Office it doesn't mean you will like the US show. The first season of US version can be compared to the English version because they were trying to use the same formula, but they couldn't do it well enough. From season 2 they reinvented the whole thing and did a completely new show, totally different from the original.,So if you like season 2 of US Office you will like all following seasons just the same. My favorite season is the fourth but that doesn't mean the others are not as good.",The Office,10
the problem for me..........,"the problem for me was some little things.having worked in various offices I can tell you Americans don't act so mousy or reserved and nervous as shown on the American version. ,it may seem right how English people are but not Americans. also, sometimes a boss sets the tone for an office. and seeing how he is such a clown, it baffles me how people would be so reserved in his office.,there were some bright spots, but the British version was so good that its hard for me to get over it and accept this version even though I am American and want to like it. I will give it a shot though.I need to find a good series to watch and seeing as I thought the original office ended way too soon, cripes after only 2 seasons??come on!",The Office,5
Pretty Good,"The Characters are awesome, Dwight, Michael, Kevin, and Pam are my favorites.,The episodes are good, but none have been standout so far. I like them all about the same.,Ryan and Jan are very bad and annoying.,I think this show is not an 8.8.,Many episodes are too awkward.,It is not very funny but it is still good.,I like the Office.,7/10",The Office,7
Really guys?,"Usually I don't feel compelled to comment on these things but I just had to say that most of the people I saw who left negative comments on this show only watched ONE episode! The first episode wasn't my favorite. But you become attached to the characters so quickly! It is hard to say that Michael is just an idiot, he has so much heart and just wants to be loved. I don't care what anyone says, Dwight is hilarious. And the show can be so easy to relate to sometimes. Don't tell me you have never had your Jim or your Pam. I mean, there are so many human moments that sometimes it leaves me feeling emotional (though they are rarer). And it definitely has its uncomfortable moments (especially when Toby starts to get creepy). There is so much good to this show, and it is so unlike so many of the terrible shows out there. I can understand loyalty, and I know America and Britain are different countries. But if you get past the FIRST episode and really give it a chance, there is a lot to love here! I have never seen the original Office, and I intend to watch it someday. And I promise I will keep an open mind.",The Office,10
The Office....you're fired!,"I'm just thunderstruck. All the buzz around this show, it making Time Magazine's Best of 2005 list, huge ratings. Well, tonight as favor to a friend, I gave it a look. Usually I don't take the time to review something I don't like (which is basically all of today's TV), but I was so stunned at how atrocious this was, I had to say something. I checked out ""Booze Cruise"" I believe it was called, where all the employees boarded a ship. Not only is the directorial style distracting, but this may be the unfunniest ""sitcom"" I've laid eyes on in my life. It was as bad as an actual office during the day; uninvolving conversations, characters and a storyline I didn't care about, and just shockingly boring. They say humor is relative, and maybe I just don't ""get it"", because this is a hit. But I'd bet a buck that if you stuck 20 people in a room and turned this on, stone-cold silence would be your result. Just mind-numbingly dull.",The Office,
"Great show, my favorite comedy","This show is flat out funny. From Steve Carrell's perfect performance of Michael Scott to Rainn Wilson's even better portrayal of the ever-funny, ever-maniacal Dwight Schrute. Aside from the humor, there is a very good sense of character development and relationships as well, which is refreshing. Jim and Pam are the go-to couple for a comedy couple. Going back to the first few seasons I would get frustrated because I would just be dying for them to be together, but that adds to the fun and intrigue of the show. The other supporting characters are also very funny such as Stanley, Andy and probably my personal favorite secondary character: Kevin. The flaws of this show are two things: When Michael left, the show was good but not the same, and Andy became quite annoying as the show played on. A highlight of the later seasons is Erin; she is pretty, funny, and a dork--which is perfect for my sense of humor. All told, this is a great show that is definitely worth binge-watching, but just make sure you can stay up(that's what she said).",The Office,9
A Solid and Fulgurant show even for fastidious people,"When i watched the first series i was not sure what to expect because i thought : what can happen in an office , and won't it be boring after the first few episodes ?? Boy, was i wrong !!!!! I've just finished watching series 5 and this is one of the only shows where i laugh out loud with every episode that i watch ; and that means a lot to me at this very day what with most of the shows i watch i can't do better than a silent grin. In Fact this and Friends are the only shows that i can rate the almighty 10, because of course a show can never be flawless ,,but with that in mind they deserve the highest score i can give them.",The Office,10
Who Cares If It's Funny If The Directing Gives You A Headache?,"I mean really. What's with NBC shows and the ShakyCam? Do they think they're going to get big audiences by making their audience want to go to the bathroom to part with their dinner? And never mind that shaking the camera constantly is completely meaningless and adds absolutely, nothing, zilch, nada to the interest of the story. Rather, it detracts from it to the point where it becomes just plainly unwatchable.,Why does NBC think it has failed to attract an audience after spending millions launching, re-launching, re-re-launching and buying awards to this pale excuse for a sitcom.,It makes you long for boringly filmed sitcoms with a stationary camera. At least you could pay attention to the jokes.",The Office,2
My Friends on T.V.,"There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the  singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes  in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too.  The humor is universal.  I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced.  Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing.  Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!",Friends,

The best American TV has to offer,"'Friends' is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.,There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of 'Friends'. My guess is they've never seen or paid attention to the show. It's easy to discard something because ""everyone likes it"" and be ""unique"", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgements - chances are you'll fall in love with it too. I would have serious doubts about one's sense of humor if I heard that they hated 'Friends'.",Friends,10
The Best Show Ever,"Everyone says that Seinfield is the greatest show ever. I love Seinfield but it doesn't come close to Friends. Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show.",Friends,
Where are YOUR Friends?,"I've been reading a lot of these comments. Some people don't like the show...claiming it to be unrealistic or that the plot lines get boring.,I didn't discover Friends until a year or two ago (thanks to MY friends) but I ADORE the show in syndication and I hope to own the DVDs. Its damn funny and no one can deny it. Except for stiffs. And whats best about Friends is that its REAL.,Ross and Rachel getting old? How could it? Do relationships get old in real life? No, they're ongoing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes changing. Thats REAL.,This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change. You grow both closer to and further from your biological family, and as you reach more independence, you adopt another family of your own: YOUR FRIENDS.,We may not all sit in coffee shops, but we all LOVE our friends like they were blood. That's what this show is about. Makes you all warm and fuzzy (and sore from laughing) inside. And as a show: FRIENDS will always be a part of MY family.",Friends,

Humour getting feeble? absolutely not. In fact it's getting better. OK, so perhaps they're beginning to ""pair up"" the six of them, but so what. Chandler's sarcasm is still as funny as ever. Monica's quirkiness still works. Phoebe's goofiness still brings about a smile. And Joey,Rachel and Ross are still as funny as they always were.

One of the best sitcoms ever,"After seeing every episode of this much loved sitcom i much say that the writers and cast have succeeded in making something that is not only humorous, but also forces you to care about the characters and what happens to them in the future.

Each one of the characters is funny in their own way and due to the shows fast pace there is never a boring episode.,I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good. I started watching the show at series five but from then on i was hooked.,I recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone.",Friends,
The greatest show on television,"Friends is an excellent tv show.  All of the actors are excellent!,People are saying they don't understand it, which confuses me. It's great entertainment! Friends are talking and living their life, and you see what goes on.  It's going to be hell when it is finally over! The writers are the best I have seen. How could it be a horrible show when actresses such as Jennifer Aniston have won Golden Globes because of her work in it. No one who has watched this show once can say they did not laugh their ass off at least once during the 30 minute period!",Friends,
fantastic,Friends has got to be one of the best Us Sitcom comedys ever. I'll be sad for this programme to end next year in 2004 because the whole team did such a fantastic effort to put everthing into this series.

One of the best t.v. shows ever!,"Easily in my top five category of funniest and best shows in prime time history.,Everyone on this show is so witty and delivers their lines superbly that it's hard not to like all of them equally.  However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.,We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.,Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:,Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.,Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: ,Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.,Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:,It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.,Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: ,Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.,David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:,It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.,Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:,They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.,So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.  It's one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years, and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list.,And that's my review.",Friends,
Keep Watching,"I have never watched the British version of this show so I cannot comment on the original. I was under the impression it was a new Showtime story. ,I have to admit that started watching because I have always been a fan of William H Macy. However, viewing Macy in this kind of role was startling . I had always seen him in more conventional-almost typecast - parts. I knew that Joan Cusak was a quality actress which lent the project some further credibility. ,At first the show seemed to be almost forced. The plot seemed bizarre, and unbelievable. It seemed awkward. Its quite common for shows to take time to develop chemistry when the actors haven't defined their characters yet. The same can be said for the writers. ,However, I had never seen anything like it. In that regard it was dynamic and worth the time. The young actors soon found their roles and by the 5th episode I found myself thinking about the show every day. ,Now I cant stop watching. Im addicted. The actors are fantastic. The plots are far more developed. The supporting players play a big part in the series, and new characters keep rotating in flawlessly. The show has evolved . ,And just for the record, Im getting really sick and tired of people trashing the show because in their minds it doesn't measure up to the original. Its not supposed to be the original. If you don't like it, stick with the British show.",Shameless,10
Friends TV Series Review (1994 - 2004),"Follows the personal and professional lives of six 20 to 30-something years old friends living in Manhattan. Friends has a simple plot and story but what makes this show so iconic is the 6 main characters and actors Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green, Courteney Cox as Monica Geller, Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay, Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing and David Schwimmer as Dr. Ross Geller. I watch the show once in a while every weekend and i always laugh with Joey and Chandler they bring the most laughs but honestly all 6 of them are very talented and funny and it's a shame that they can't find a project this days to showcase that i also liked the special guests like Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis or even Jean Claude Van Damme. Friends is not just a great TV show but it's also a great TV show back then and now because it holds up really well.",Friends,10
All-Time Best Sitcom,"I love this show so much! F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a sitcom that you could easily binge-watch at any time of the day. I was able to finish the whole 10 seasons, which ran for 10 years, in under a month. That's just how great it is! I can't even give it a negative review about anything. You'll just really learn to love all the characters through time. No wonder people have clamored for a reunion with the cast, you just can't get enough of it.,When you're feeling down and think you could use a good laugh, put this one on top of your to-watch list. It doesn't matter that the show ran from 1994-2004, the humor it had is timeless!,In a perfect world where we could pick a series that could run forever, F.R.I.E.N.D.S would be that show. Notice how different TV networks are still doing re-runs at present time even after it has ended back in '04. You'll find that a new generation of viewers who are watching and loving it are surprised to discover that the cast are quite old already. Nothing could beat it.",Friends,10
A triumph of American television,"I've grown up with the original Shameless. It's a fast paced Comedy-Drama like no other, in that it lends itself perfectly to both without apology or hesitation.,Whereas the British original finds it's characters living, fornicating, screaming and jumping in the revelry of zero-expectation in a rigid class system, the American remake masterfully equivocates the triumphs and the tribulations of a lower class family existing on the edge of acceptability at the heart of society in a flawless, delicate and shameless manner.,The pilot introduces the characters, much like their British counterparts, not in an effort to garner their sympathy but simply as a statement of fact. The aspiring teen marine struggling to hide his homosexuality only fears losing the love of his brother, the absent drunk dad who loves his children but through the haze becomes a heckling prophet - a Shakespearean fool who sees through the thin veil of sanity and order, a young woman struggling to keep the family together seeing a way out through a handsome highwayman. These people are not bad even if they do bad things. Society has forgot about them and for that they couldn't care less for it.,The whole cast is tremendous but William H. Macy rises to the occasion with the father, a Frank Gallagher straight out of a bar in Memphis at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday, last orders, don't interrupt him because he hasn't finished yet, he's got to tell you what's wrong with the world before he wakes up and it all ends. You would believe this guy was a war vet or something with the confidence and delirium at which he pontificates.,No matter what your race or background you can take something away from Shameless. Most television that likes to call itself Comedy, Drama, or both, tends towards a particular demographic, offering an escape fantasy for, say, the 'off-beat' teens in Glee or the sexually deviant young adults in True Blood or the repressed housewives in that show about the repressed housewives.,As the designated guardian's new boyfriend takes a seat at the head of the table, he pushes Frank's legs aside as he crashes drunk on the floor. Shameless doesn't escape anything, it lives in the world it is given and every so often reminds you, during those joyously chaotic scenes, that the sweetest lemonade is almost bitter, so it's just as well every episode is only an hour for you to laugh, cry and enjoy.,Moments of anarchic jubilation inter lap, run over and sometimes juxtapose flourishes of near-the-bone reality, served eloquently on a fresh platter to which America needs to to have the stomach for.",Shameless,10
I've seen both.  The American is better.  (But not by a lot),"I was halfway through the American series before I even KNEW there was a British series. I think a was a little disappointed that we didn't create it, but I was also happy that it was one of the few shows that we copied without ruining it. When I checked some of the user reviews, I was surprised to see how many thought the show to be appalling. OK, not everyone will share my love for the show, but to rate it SO badly? But when I looked, the author of nearly every bad review was a fan of the original show. This simply sounds like a case of liking what you know. ""I don't care how good their cooking is. It ain't as good as my Mom's!"",Once I finished the American series, I gave it about a month to settle in and then started watching the British series. But I'd like to think that I was objective enough to judge it on its on merits, and not simply that it's different than what I'm used to.,Since, as many have pointed out, the script is nearly word-for-word identical, the difference lies mainly in how the actors portray the characters.,So I'm going to give my character-by-character head-to-head appraisal of UK vs. US. I'm going to use the character names rather than the actors' names for simplicity. Starting from the youngest...,Little Debbie: UK wins this one hands down. No contest. She steals every scene she's in. Who can not fall in love with this girl???,Carl: This one's close, but the UK one is (at least in the first season) a little more deranged and fun to watch.,Ian: Another close one, but this goes to UK, too. US Ian is somber and good looking, but UK Ian always seems a bit panicky, and the wide-angle closeups of his face make him look pretty bizarre. ,Lip: This is solidly with the US. I like US Lip's darkness. He seems more responsible and intelligent. UK Lip is just kind of impish and unsure. You can depend on US Lip and he offers some of the only real family support to Fiona.,Kevin: Dead heat.,Veronica: Very different performances by each, but in the end, I like them the same.,Fiona: This was a difficult one to call, but I'm giving it to the US. And this is probably because I saw them first. I just like her better. Hard to put my finger on the reason.,Frank: Sorry, UK, but I just don't like your Frank. I understand the character is usually drunk, but he seems that way even before he starts drinking. He seems clinically stupid. US Frank (Macy) is equally as obnoxious, entitled, selfish and deluded, but he only seems drunk when he's drunk. At other times, his pontificating is fun to listen to. You feel good about hating the guy, because he's like this by choice. With UK Frank, you have to pity him. I feel like I'm laughing at someone who's mentally challenged.",Shameless,10
"Fluid direction, crisp script, helmed by trio of fine performances","Note: I have not seen the UK version.,I wasn't sure what to make of the first episode of Shameless. I wasn't sold on the characters and the direction seemed directionless. In fact, it wasn't until the third ep that my eyes were opened. It's as if the actors have found their mark and the characters have come to life. ,While the ensemble cast is solid, and Macy is at his irascible best, it is the performance of three of the actors which makes Shameless something special. Emmy Rossum, as the 'adult' glue that holds the family together, has rightly received the most press. Her role requires a combination of strength, resolve, humour and vulnerability - qualities that would thwart a lesser actress. Rossum is able to convincingly bring it all together with fire and sexuality in addition to her other qualities. ,Equally effective in his role as the younger brother Lip, Jeremy Allen White brings a world-weary innocence to his character. Blessed with a malleable physiognomy, White is at once rascal and protector of the brood. White makes us want to know Lip better. That's rare.,In a smaller role but probably my favourite is Emma Kenney as little sister Debbie. Her deadpan wisecracks supply the laugh-out-loud moments while her heartbreaking scenes of longing for parental love bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened soul. She can act toe-to-toe with Macy and still steal the scene.,The rest of the cast is almost as good. Their performances would be wasted, however, without a tight script and fluid - but not frenetic - direction. The third episode brought all these pieces together in a fascinating show. Whether the writing and direction can sustain this level of quality over a season we don't know. What we do have for now is some of the best ensemble acting you will see on TV or on film.",Shameless,8
Probably the last and the longest of the great network sitcoms,"Suffice it to say that Friends is a classic comic treatment of what I have always called the ""post-college adolescent phase"" of life, which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life. It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you ""settle down"" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor.,It follows the life of six young people living in New York City from 1994 to 2004, so even now a few of the cultural references will be stale, but the relationship truths never will be. Ross is the nerdy guy who grew up to be a little uncomfortable in his skin but still very good looking. Ross' sister Monica is an aspiring chef who is now thin but was obese up until the middle of high school. Rachel has been Monica's friend since high school and is adjusting to life without daddy's credit card when the series begins, and is looking for a career in fashion. Chandler, Ross' friend since college, is successful in his budding career in business. Rounding out the group is Joey, not the brightest bulb in the room, who wants to be an actor and as a result works a series of odd jobs and stars in a series of odder commercials and the occasional appearance on a TV show. Finally there is Phoebe. Her history with the group doesn't go much past the beginning of the series as she's had a rather Bohemian upbringing that has led to a Bohemian adulthood. Complicating factor as the series begins - Ross' wife has just declared she is gay and left him for another woman, Ross now and always has had a crush on Rachel who doesn't know he's alive, and Ross' wife discovers she is pregnant by Ross shortly after the separation.,One of the best shows on TV with the most heart and the most laughs. Highly recommended.",Friends,10
Awesome Show,"I don't leave reviews very often but I had to for this show. I have not seen the UK version and don't really care to because this show is just top notch. I had never heard of this show since I work overseas but ended up catching the 5th episode and absolutely loved it. I told all of the guys in the fire station about it and ever since we have had to catch up on all of the previous episodes. Everyone in the department loves this show and that is a hard thing to do. All of the characters are just great and have so many flaws. William H. Macy does an awesome job as the dysfunctional father. I gave it the highest review I think a show can receive because I don't think there is a perfect show, but this comes darn close. I definitely recommend this show.",Shameless,9
For those who've never seen the original,"Many of the reviews on here are complaining about how much the U.S. version copies the original. I've not seen a single episode of the original and, to me, the U.S. version is well acted, entertaining and perhaps one of my new favorites. I could care less that it's word for word from the original because this is all new to me. The actors portray the characters amazingly and I feel the storyline represents struggling families realistically. Each character will remind you of someone you know or have known. So for those who are like me and you've never seen the original, I absolutely suggest checking out Shameless, the U.S. remake. I look forward to seeing the rest of the season and maybe one day I'll even check out the original.",Shameless,10
the most lovable show ever..,"FRIENDS is the best sitcom ever made. It is one of the things which made my growing up years special. This is the first TV show I watched and absolutely loved. It taught us friendship, love and loyalty. It has the most adorable characters and one can never get tired of watching reruns. FRIENDS is just pure joy which leaves inside you a warm fuzzy feeling, lifting your spirits and instantly brightening your mood. It is the only show which can make you laugh, cry, fall in love even after all these years. It inspires. The dialogues make me laugh and cry even though I have already watched and heard them countless times. It is timeless. It still feels so difficult to watch the last episode because you do not want it to end. I love this show and I am so sure I will love it even 30years from now. The most beautiful, funny and inspiring show ever. I just wish there were more seasons, though they ended the show as beautifully as possible, I loved the show too much to see it ending. FRIENDS always. :)",Friends,10
The Greatest Show Ever!!!,"Personally I get rid of all my tension,stress when i watch the show. There isn't a single episode i doesn't like.,All the 10 seasons are great. It gives our life back.It shows us that there's lot in this world for living. A must watch.While watching the show i always feel like i wish i have those friends. ,I like Chandler very much,especially his ""hi5"".Joey's ""How u doing?"",Phoebe's ""Smelly Cat"".Monica's food,Ross's paleontology classes and Rachel.......I miss all of it and I miss this show a lot.And also the comedy in this goes great season to season.It'll be good if they make a film on it.And that's why its the greatest show ever!!! ,Friends'is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.",Friends,10
Great Cast and Great Plot,"I'll start by saying that if you have watched the UK version of this (Which by the way was made by Channel 4 and Company Pictures and NOT the BBC as these other reviews suggest) You probably won't enjoy this first episode. Its a straight transition of the script with some adjustments.,However having seen shows that were changed beyond all recognition I can say that is a good thing.,The cast are excellent in their roles and the story which is far from the usual tame fodder of American drama is handled with honesty and realism. The characters mostly have their own interests to consider as well as the kids trying to keep their family together. ,William H Macy is ideal in a role which doesn't allow him much initial screen time but I'm sure future episodes will focus on him since Frank is such a fascinating character. Can't wait for episode 2.",Shameless,8
Addicting.,"I watched the first 2 seasons of Shameless in one month. It's that good. Shameless is witty, funny, fresh, and just overall, amazing, and all because of the characters. You have Frank, the alcoholic father of six, Monica, the bi-polar mom who split long ago. Then there's Fiona, the early-twenties oldest child, who dropped out of high school and works odd jobs to support the other five kids. Lip, short for Philip, is the genius teenager, Ian is the gay one, who desperately want to join the Army. Then Carl, who likes to light road-kill on fire, and Debbie, the ""little-mother"" type, and Liam, the half-black infant. Fi does her best to take care of her brothers, and sisters, as well as balance some sort of social life. Shameless combines issues of alcoholism, crime, juvenile delinquents, gay teens, mental disorder, drugs, alcohol, foster care, polygamist colonies, teen pregnancy, illegal immigration, and it deals with these issues in an appealing way. Overall, Shameless is one of the best shows currently on TV.",Shameless,
not as bad as you think it is.,"I cant seem to understand the hate for the American version, i am a huge fan of the Original series, actually the preview for this got me into the original series! after watching the pilot of this, i can say its gonna be good, and its something America needs, besides another ""reality series"" whether you're watching the original or American remake its still a good show. however there are a few things changed in the American remake and they are very subtle changes, like Ian being interested in the military and Liam being black, those are the only huge changes. there were allot of drastic changes made to the original series which made it much better, such as getting rid of some characters and adding a bunch of new ones. lets just hope this remakes gets to live 7 seasons.",Shameless,10
no other show comes close,"I try........not too hard, but I try.........to watch other sitcoms and actually try to ""hee-hee"" and understand the humor, but I can't! Will & Grace, and their annoying ""who's your daddy cr@p"", Two-Men-And Whatever-And-A-Pizza-Place, ohmigod... give me a friggin' break!,It's not just that there is so much chemistry between the ""Friends"" cast that the TV could explode, though this is true. Actually, maybe that's the main reason it is as good as it is. What I mean: Although it is a show full of inside jokes that you understand a lot better if you've seen every episode before the one you're watching, it isn't *essential* to have seen any episodes before to start liking it and being hooked instantly. That's how it happened to me.,I didn't start watching until season 4!! But once I did, I thought Rachel Green, Jen Aniston's char, was the coolest, and the cutest character. Now, it's more generic. I especially adore Joey and Chandler of course, and I also like the other three. Each character, except unfortunately for Monica, has grown positively in their own way.,On a sidenote, I really do hope that the ""anchor"" quality Monica's character used to have can come back a bit in season 7.  Especially as Chandler's fiance/ now, it would be a terrible thing to waste her character on just simple humor they exposed her character to in the last few seasons.,Being a Friends fanatic, allthesame, I wouldn't want this awesome show (especially) to have even the *slightest* chance of wearing out its welcome. As it is, the cast agreed to sign for 2 more seasons(this one and an 8th), and I really hope it can keep up the quality it's always had in these to come. Although I adore Friends, I don't see any reason why they would want to tire a sitcom after these seasons are over. Especially since all 6 are extremely talented actors in their own right.,-----***WATCH FRIENDS EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT, ONLY ON -- NBC -- !!!**----------,Could I *be* any more emphatic?  =)",Friends,
A show where drama and comedy feels like home,"I feel like Shameless is super underrated! It's a show where drama and comedy make a very good mixture. They strengthen the veracity of the events from the show, because this kind of things represent the cruel and bitter reality we live. It's an amazing show that'll hit you right in the feels. It's one of the most realistic show I've watched. It's an one of a kind show. Oh and... that love/hate relationships with many characters (beacuse you'll have them) will make you love this show even more.",Shameless,10
Pretty damn good for an American remake,"the original British version is one of my favourite shows on TV and when i first heard that they were remaking it in the states, i like many others had serious doubts of it translating well, especially if you think of how glamorous American TV is and how unglamourous a show like shameless is. However i can safely say that John Wells and Showtime really have nailed it in adapting the show for the US audience. this can be said with how successful the show has been in America, which is great because it sort of mimics the same success the UK version had when it debuted in 2004. Despite there being some flaws, Showtime have overall done a terrific job in adapting shameless. ,while the story lines for the first season are pretty much americanised versions of the first series of the British version, there are several episodes that have there own story lines and the whole of season 2 completely deviates from the British story lines, in fact while watching season 2, the show felt more of a completely different show rather than a remake. the acting from everyone is very good, especially from Emmy Rossum, Joan cusack and William Macy. the story lines that the US writing team come up with are generally very inventive and have that same tongue and cheek humour that the British series has. the chemistry between Lip and Ian as well as Fiona and Steve is one of the strongest aspects of the show. the music is also great and fits into the show well. ,Now i am going to talk about the flaws of the show. even though i am from the UK and am not entirely familiar with American culture and how people live, there doesn't seem to be that much poverty to the show. the show just seems to be too glamorous and clean as opposed to the grittiness of the original UK version. another problem i have is William Macy as Frank. to me, David Threlfall IS Frank and while Macy isn't bad in the role, he just doesn't have that same quality that Threlfall delivers in the UK version. many fans of the UK version may also find the deviations in this version to be quite off-putting.,Overall, do i prefer this version to the original? the answer is No, i don't. while the acting, the story lines, the music and the overall feel to the show is great, this version just doesn't have the same spark as the original one has and i can also relate to the UK one more. if you are a fan of the UK version, you may find this remake hard to enjoy, however if you are able to ignore the fact that it is based on a British show and treat it as an entirely different show altogether, Shameless USA can be a very fun and entertaining show. if your American and haven't seen either version, then you probably will enjoy the US version more than the UK version.",Shameless,8
A series No one will EVER forget,"If you want a show that is filled with romance/drama and comedy, this is the show that is fit for you, because it IS filled with romance,drama and comedy that is why wherever I go I will NEVER forget that show,those characters and those series. I am unlikely to give good reviews but F.R.I.E.N.D.S really captured my heart!,This show is the BEST show that I EVER watched because: 1.It makes me laugh. 2.Whenever I am lonely I watch the show so that I will be happy again. 3.The actors and actresses portray their characters very well. 4.The stories are unique. 5.The script IS Amazing!,So now that I gave you the reasons why I love it... I now recommend you to watch It!",Friends,10

Build by great comedy and incredible story, Friends definitly will make who ever watched it could not get over it. All of the cast was amazing. Matthew Perry as Chandler was one of my favourite. With all of his sarcastic jokes, he always make me laugh out loud. FYI i watched Friends in 2018 so, to be honest i only got 85% of their jokes. However i still enjoy the hell out of it. If i were 40 years old, maybe i could enjoy it even more.",Friends,10

Hanging out with the Gallaghers,"I don't know if you can call 2011 the year the BBC invaded American television, but it comes darn close. The first of the shows to premiere in the new year will be Showtime's version of the British award winning Shameless. Shameless follow Frank Gallagher, played by William H. Macy, and his not quite normal family. For instance the youngest of the Gallagher clan is quite obviously not Frank's yet that isn't even the family's biggest concern. Nor would it be the fact that in order to make ends meet and keep the electricity from being turned off all the kids chip in including the youngest daughter who takes up a collection that is supposed to be turned into Unicef. Yeah those are problems alright, but like I said they aren't the Gallagher's biggest problem. Their biggest problem would be Frank and his inability to stay sober long enough to pay more than his bar tab at the neighborhood pub.,With that being said the first 21 minutes of Shameless doesn't detour much from the British version and that's OK. Instead of feeling as though I had seen it before (which I had) I just felt as though I was being introduced to a new slightly (overly) dysfunctional family. This was mostly in part to the cast who not only owned their roles they owned whatever scenes they were in and I don't say this lightly. Not once during the preview did I feel as though this was a family I was supposed to pity and feel bad for. This was a family I wanted to know and to hang out with. Luckily for me starting Sunday January 9, 2011 I get to hang out with the Gallagher family.",Shameless,8
One of my all time favorite series!,"This is a great show with unexpected twists all the time. Always entertaining. However, as poor as this family is supposed to be, I wish the producers would pay more attention to details, such as brand name items in the kitchen. People who pawn xbox and laptops to buy food would only have cheap, generic stuff in the house. Just sayin'.",Shameless,10
fashion,"far to be its fan, it is not easy to ignore its powerful social impact, result of the simple and precise recipes . it is not easy to not admire the traces of the characters, the dialogue, the smart manner to analyze the Peter Pan syndrome and to discover good performances of the actors who transform a sitcom in cultural phenomenon. Friends has the special gift to transform fiction in situations who becomes so real than the viewer becomes part of the story. and this episode by episode. childish and smart, a film about the friendship and the refuse to grow up, seductive mixture of chaos, humor and thin tension, it is one of the pieces of the revolution of TV industry in the ""90's. but the strange fact is the art to be more than proof of the spirit of a period. and this does it irresistible.",Friends,
Easily One of the Best Shows in The History of TV!,"If somebody says that Friends is the best TV show ever, my sense of disagreement would be minuscule. Personally for me, Friends is a contender for the best, definitely top 5. Many people do not like sitcoms, but everybody loves this show! There was many copycats afterwards, none of which equalled the original. Twelve years after its cancellation, everyone still treats Friends with the highest honour as they did back in its heyday, which was all ten seasons.,Friends deals with the escapades of six best friends living in New York City. Courtney Cox is excellent as Monica Geller, a chef who is a neat-freak and perfectionist. She was also overweight in her childhood, which is often what people make fun of to her most often. Jennifer Aniston's breakout role was the daddy's little girl Rachel Green. She moves back to the city in the premiere after walking out of her wedding, and she slowly rides up the world of fashion throughout the rest of the series. Lisa Kudrow's best performance she has ever and will ever do is playing the former street-thug-turned hippie, Phoebe Buffay. Phoebe is a masseuse and aspiring musician, who has the saddest backstory, but humour comes out of it in the best ways. Ross Geller is the role I will always see David Schwimmer in. He is Monica's geeky older brother who holds a Ph.D in paleontology. He works at the museum then as a professor at NYU. He marries a lesbian and has a son with her, but she doesn't find out her true sexual nature until sometime after she got pregnant. Matthew Perry plays the hilarious Chandler Bing, who is more subtly funny to the point where people don't get his jokes. He has a weird marketing job he hates, but keeps it due to his talent and multiple raises. Matt LeBlanc plays the group's idiot, Joey Tribbiani. Joey is a talented actor who would have been more successful earlier if not for his stupidity. He loves food and women, but is very well-meaning.,One of the best things that happens in the show is that the characters stay themselves throughout the show and the main characters comprise of just the six of them. It happens all the time where characters change styles. For instance, in Three's Company, the character Chrissy goes from being a beautiful dumb blonde to a very juvenile girl. And the characters in Friends remain played by the same people. I hate when shows change actors. And the pact remains just the six of them, with the opening credits comprising of just our six leads. Nobody comes in and nobody leaves.,All characters are equally involved in their lives in such significant ways throughout the series. Ross has had the hots for Rachel since high school, and they dates sporadically in the series. Chandler and Monica have an affair and eventually get married. More chemistry is shared so smart and so vibrant that makes for great viewing. ,Since the characters, consistency, and arcs were so good, it is only natural for it to become so beloved. Whenever I watch it, I feel so darn good! That must be the effects of other people too, given its popularity. ,These six friends love each other and I do too. They make each other feel good, and they make me feel good.",Friends,10
"You should watch this, I mean it","I really enjoyed watching ""shameless"" because the of the great play of actors, and also because of the interesting story. The series feel so alive and real, with all these problems always coming up with the Gallaghers. This family is so messed up and fun to watch, that I can't have enough of one episode at a time, I need like two at once to get satisfied. This poor family, always stealing, cheating and lying to survive, doing drugs and so on, one can never get bored with their chaos and dysfunction. I am planning to watch the original version so that I can compare the both, it's really interesting to see all the characters in another way. A great thanks to the guys that shoot this series. I have not yet watched the original version of ""shameless"", but I am sure that if I do watch the British version, I will still love the both of them the same.",Shameless,9
THE BEST SHOW EVER MADE (Needed to be written with capitals!),"I'll keep it simple and short. This is the one and only show/movie I gave ''10 out of 10'', and if there was 11 i would gave it 11. Why? Humor in shows and movies evolve, what's funny today, won't be funny tomorrow, and what was funny yesterday, won't be funny today, but the thing with ''Friends'' is that their humor is not predictable in any way as that is case with other shows, and they make you laugh every time you watch them, no matter if you've watched them 100 times or more. It's one of those shows that you can watch with friends, girlfriend or alone. It's also one of those shows that you can watch no matter if you're sad or happy, it'll always make you smile.

One of the Best Comedies of All Time,"Looking back on the run of the TV series ""Friends"", it is easy to see why it was so popular. The casting gave America six young adults who actually felt like they were our friends. On each episode, after its catchy theme song by The Rembrandts, we got to visit with a cast of such well developed characters who we liked: ,Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) is the beautiful, yet accessible and funny, girl who became a style setter. The country followed her hairstyles and the drama of her ever-evolving relationship with Ross.,Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) is the nerdy PhD who struggled with the timing of his relationships, managing to marry and divorce before finally getting a shot at the love of his life, Rachel. In my opinion, Aniston and Swimmer were the talents that elevated this show beyond good to great. When you watch their performances, their comic timing is perfect and their characterizations feel true.,Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) is Ross' sister and the neurotic neat freak who still bears scars from her younger fat days. Besides some very interesting relationships, she eventually marries another one of the friends. She is hyper-competitive, especially when it comes to games or sports.,Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is the class clown. Could anyone BE any funnier? His bromance with Joey is the center of his life until he falls for Monica.,Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) is the clueless actor who knows how to score with women (""How YOU doin'?"") and shares his passions for games and ""Baywatch"" with Chandler.,Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) is the kooky folk singer with a penchant for writing odd songs, like ""Smelly Cat."" She has a twin sister who is also ""out there"", and an unusual past.,The writers for this show had some great talent to write for, but the writing itself always gave us funny premises, great ongoing gags, and the occasional touching moment. It was always fun to invite them into our homes and experience their trials and celebrations.",Friends,10
A series that will make you suffer,"/* Update Season 4 - warning spoilers*/,I am absolutely disgusted by season 4.,Am I the only one to think the evolution of most characters doesn't make any sense at all?,Fiona, a paragon of responsibility, strong enough to support a family of lunatics, juggling between so many jobs suddenly does drug, lets drug in range of her baby brother and most of all refuses to take full responsibility for the incident? She dates a brother and sleeps with the other one many times ?,Lip destroys a handful of cars in front of the university but isn't expelled or investigated in any way ?,Seems only Carl acts like he always had.,Medically, we have one miracle after the other. Frank survives despite having been diagnosed by two doctors as being days away from his death. Kevin and Veronica having babies in spite of a 99,999 % odds against.,I sure hope season 5 reverse the trend or I'm done with the series.,/* End Update Season 4 - warning spoilers*/,After all that happens she has no other idea than violate her house arrest to almost overdose with the brother that destroyed her life ?,Shameless is a TV series with lots going for it.,The excellent cast makes the many relationships (love, romance, brotherhood, friendship) credible, interesting and even addicting.,The writers manage to intertwine many stories at the same time with different views and outlook on life, from kids to elderlies, which is quite refreshing.,While it relates quite a hard and sometimes horrendous reality, the ever present humor helps make it palatable, as well as the drive, the courage and the sense of community of most family members and friends.,It is quite heart braking to watch Monica and Frank though. While most characters in spite of their darkness have some redeeming qualities (the grandmother for example who in the end gives the money to her sons and even wants to get additional city money by trying to get run by a bus) it is very hard to find anything positive about the parents. They are absolutely selfish and one episode after another is a show of how they constantly bend everything to their advantage.,Frank in particular is a tough sell. He will go so far as to kill for money (preventing a heart transplant) and thinks of only one thing: himself.,It is a testament to the brilliance of the writers as well as the formidable acting of Macy that one still cares about his character.",Shameless,4
"This is excellent TV, but not for children or the easily offended","Confession first - I usually like British TV shows, but have always found US adaptations lacking. For Instance, I really like the UK version of Being Human, and cannot make myself watch a complete episode of the US version; I would perhaps feel differently if I hadn't seen entire UK version before watching the US version.,Well I'd never seen or even heard of the UK version of Shameless, and I only started watching the US version from the beginning of season 2. Somehow I stumbled across an episode earlier this month, and read largely favorable reviews, save some who'd seen the UK version first. I then used Showtime On Demand to watch the entire second season. ,I highly recommend the show, but believe that some people might be offended by the harsh language, nudity, and sexual content as the show is full of all three. If this were a movie playing at the cinema, it would likely be rated NC-17; as it's on subscription TV, it's rated TV- MA (Adult Content, Graphic Language, Nudity). If such content offends your sensibilities, you will not like this show, and should just avoid it; this is no show for children.,Shameless is a good title for the program; an alternative, more descriptive title might be ""Social Dysfunction Olympics: One family's race to the bottom"". It's listed as being a Drama and Comedy, but the comedy is usually of the tragic or dark variety. The core family, their friends and neighbors are multi-generation families in a poor neighborhood on the south side of Chicago. The current generation of siblings have largely raised themselves because the parents are too busy chasing their next score, whether that be money, booze, or drugs; you quickly realize that sex is often a tool used to score.,The father and mother are perhaps the most reprehensible people one could imagine, but the way it plays out, they usually show just enough humanity to allow the audience to not want to kill them. The children are better people than their parents, and the parents are perhaps slightly better than the grandmother. It's all so tragic, but there are also heart warming scenes. Each episode is like an emotional roller-coaster ride, eliciting concern, fear, frustration, and laughter from the audience.,If you have not seen the show before, there is a writeup at wikipedia which gives plenty of background on each of the characters, but also contains significant spoilers. Make sure to lookup the US version as the UK is different and also listed.,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shameless_(U.S._TV_series)",Shameless,9
Loved the British Original...US version tops it,"I've followed the original version in the UK since it started and it's still going strong (to correct an earlier reviewer it wasn't aired on the BBC, it's a Channel Four series). I therefore approached this with apprehension. To take a loved UK program and set it in the US has a history of failures but I liked the look of the trailer and gave it a go. I have to admit that throughout the first episode I was constantly thinking 'oh she's not as good as so and so' or 'I much prefer David to William'. However there was a lot packed into that episode and the script was pretty good. Come episode two I was hooked and to honest much prefer this version.,It has cleverly achieved what the UK version has in taking a subject and a group of characters that most people should loathe and turned them into a lovable group, all beautifully portrayed. Real, rounded, believable characters and so many of them too. Many people will have been turned off this by the trailer and thought it's not for them which is a shame. It really is extremely well written with great pace and some superb performances. I love Emmy Rossum and her portrayal of Fiona is astounding. I agree that William H Macy's Frank is more likable since he isn't always drunk and Joan Cusack is perfect as Sheila (I found the UK Sheila quite annoying).,We are only up to episode 7 of the US series here in the UK and its top of my weekly viewing. Great to see they are making a second series in the US and in fact given they have plenty of material to use, since we are up to Series 8 here in the UK, I hope it has the same longevity.",Shameless,9
This show rocks,"This show put me off at first, but I got hooked because the characters are so likable that I watched Dragonball Evolution. I never had any desire to see that movie before. I've never heard the theme song ""The Luck you Got"" before this show but I really do dig it though. I think this show is very well cast and I can never tell what is going to happen next. It's a very effective break from real life. I suppose the main reason that I like it so much though is because I identify with one of the characters and it reminds me of my crazy ass family. Anyways I'm just trying to raise the rating of Shameless because I want to see more episodes. So watch the show.",Shameless,9
A Testament to the Unraveling of American Morals,"I'm no prude, but this show is insulting, debasing, and disgusting. It portrays people as the lowest form of animal. We see a 40 year old man performing cunnilingus on a teenage girl who is in a coma. We see gratuitous sex that is about as subtle as two ugly dogs going at it at the dog park. It is a revolting, disgusting experience and it just shows how western civilization has fallen at an accelerated pace. It's now in free fall.When I was a first grader in the early 1960's, I could walk to school alone, which was a mile away in a large city, and not worry about being kidnapped. I could be six or seven years old and walk to the shopping center by myself or hunt for lizards in a field without fear of being kidnapped or killed. Now these days, children need to be under constant supervision or they will be grabbed from their front yard, raped, and killed. ""Shameless"", with its perversions and filthy language,accurately reflects the sick times we live in.",Shameless,1
Mark This One For the Theater,"Books, a medium for imagination, a collection of thoughts and ideas to motivate, and even more so, a springboard for Hollywood movies. Tonight's review is all about how books can certainly motivate one to do crazy things, perhaps set out on an adventure that can change your life. With a fantastic cast, this movie hopes to appeal to the modern-day audience to perhaps bring in the bucks for some laughs. Robbie K back with a written review to help you with your movie going purchases. Let's get started as we review: ,
Director:
 Bill Holderman
Writers:
 Bill Holderman, Erin Simms
Stars:
 Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen Mary Steenburgen,
LIKES:,Acting: These ladies are legends for a reason, and this movie shows off their acting talents despite the simpler roles they took on. Each one of leading ladies brings something to the table whether it be sass, sheik, sincerity, or sarcasm. Crafting believable characters, my friend and I certainly enjoyed getting to know these women who took center stage. The chemistry between them is great when together, and alone each of them carries the torch to light their way through the dark. Of the four, Candice Bergen is my favorite, as her delivery on everything was quite stellar and she had the funniest dialogue to me. ,The Lessons: I'm a sucker for a good life lesson in a movie, and Book Club manages to do a great job bringing out some important life moments that warrant a little more thought. Each of the ladies goes through their own struggles, mostly involving some aspect of life starting to dull, or practically fizzle out, as they age. Book Club's cast hits the wall placed by the advancement of time, but then begins to show just how persistent sparks can be if one takes the chances. Seeing these moments certainly in inspiring and ignites some hope as they preach the words contained within this surprisingly touching script. ,The Run Time: Movies like this can be very taxing when running too long, but Book Club manages to shrink the length of the novel down to a nice 100 minutes running time. With this concise time, comes a better pace and that leads to more entertaining maneuvers and jokes being brought in. Therefore, the boring pieces are fewer than anticipated and that means more amusement to keep me hooked into the film. ,Realism: As romantic as chick-flicks are, they often go further into fantasy than most Medieval based films do. Book Club manages to turn down the movie magic and cheese factor to deliver a respectable tale. Don't get me wrong, there are some stretches of human qualities that aren't quite believable, but still better received than a Nicholas Sparks plot. ,Used all 4 Characters: With a cast as important as this, and the price tags to go with them, I worried that they were going to skip over some of the women to favor the more popular characters. However, the team did a nice job of digging into each character's life and making sure to keep their journey relevant. The directing team kept jumping between stories, always making sure to come back at the right point to renew interests and help give the characters time to reset before jumping back into the fun at hand. It's a method I have enjoyed in the past and one I encourage to continue to be balanced as best as possible. ,The Comedy: Most fans won't find this aspect as much of a like as I have, but this is because the comedy is geared towards a particular audience. Still, this reviewer found the writing and delivery in this movie top notch for maximizing the laughs at hand. As mentioned above, Book Club's comedy comes from of course the innuendos and double meanings the trailer made famous, but it also holds sarcasm, playful romance play, and other interactions that are reminiscence of friendship. While the comedy is a bit forced at times, the cast and directing succeeded in grounding the jokes to make it feel more natural and less planned. ,DISLIKES: ,Limited Audience: You knew this from the trailers, but Book Club's intended viewers are much narrower in scope than other movies. Targeted towards the female population, this story is going to speak more to them than anyone else, which will limit its ability to entertain all the masses. In addition, some of the jokes were lost on me because I don't have the anatomy needed to find it relevant, leading to some less stimulating jokes for me. As a reviewer, I have to take these things in, so sorry if I offend. ,The Pacing: I said the pacing was decent and not too mind numbing, but Book Club does have those moments where the pace seems to crawl. Character building, yes, but in terms of keeping me hooked, these slower moments did not accomplish more than extending the run time. ,Singled Out: While I like jumping around to each woman's story, the movie failed to integrate them together as much as I had expected from the trailers. Most of the time they are on their journey of self-discovery (proving one has to find the change themselves), only convening to get the next book in the chapter. Like the show friends, or a lot of other shows, I had hoped for the girls to kind of pair up a little more, perhaps integrating into each other's story and expanding the adventure. However, they chose to keep them well isolated up until the last third where things started to run together. ,The VERDICT: , Overall, Book Club is cute, fun, and an adventure that I enjoyed more than expected. Perhaps due to the low expectation, or the clever writing and balance the movie is certainly one of the more enjoyable chick flicks I've seen in a while. Fans of these legendary ladies, or a girls group looking for fun should totally check out this film in theaters, and have one of the more enjoyable girls night outs in a while. As for the others who are not in the target audience... you are out of luck and best waiting for this on Redbox, if anything. Still, given all the lessons and humor, this movie deserves the following scores in my opinion: ,Comedy: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5",Book Club,8
Brilliant satire,"This show is unlike anything I have watched before. It's a comedy and a drama in a way it hasn't been done before. The show continues to amaze you every season with how brutal and absurd it can become, while subtly making fun of many american stereotypes in a brilliant and entertaining way. Absolutely loving it!",Shameless,10
OH MY GOD SUCH A GOOD SHOW!!!!,I love this show so much! I watched a season a day that´s how addicting it was. I totally recommend it. It is inappropriate but such an amazing show. It taught me life lessons too.,Shameless,10
Most laughs I've had in a long time,"Some of these bad reviews here must be humorless sad sacks who find little joy in life. I found this a delightful way to spend part of an afternoon with a friend! It was what I expected from trailer, nothing more, nothing less. I go to a movie to be entertained, not to pick apart everyone's physical attributes. Lighten up, have fun, enjoy the music.",Book Club,8
shameless,"as an USA spin off off channel four shameless they capture the spirit off the UK version and made it there own.,good performance all around by the crew, lead by the excellent William h Macy a very good actor indeed.,overall a solid show.",Shameless,7
Best realistic drama I have ever seen,"I have seen many TV series till now and no series have forced me to write a review about it. Shameless is one of the underrated TV series I have watched. It never got acclaim as far as award number goes on. In 2015, William H. Macy won Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series and people started noticing about the show. I have watched this series twice and I can keep watching again and again with hands down!,This show is portrayed in a very real manner. No doubt, it involves lot of nudity but come on people it's the name of the show and it indeed justifies with plot. This show never ceases to amaze me. It is pretty funny and dark at both the time. You never know what is going to happen and it is best part. It's nearly impossible to tell from one episode to the next whether Shameless is building up to something or the writers are just doing playful riffs on the Gallagher world that are intended to stand alone. The Gallaghers make all the chaotic dysfunctional stuff very reliable and real. It's unique and insane and funny and deep. I just loved the performances of William H. Macy as Frank Gallagher and Emmy Rossum as Fiona Gallagher. I watched couple of episodes of UK version but genuinely I disliked it compared to US version. Frank character in UK version is no where near as compared to US one. ,It's easy to give Shameless the benefit of the doubt, because, at its best, the show is a lot of fun.,MUST WATCH!!!",Shameless,10
For The Most Part...Fabulous!,"I had to go back and watch the first two seasons. A friend finally coerced me into watching Shameless in Season three. I had a taken a pass because I had heard all the stories about the ridiculous nudity and sex and, frankly, I am just saturated with it. I was prepared to be annoyed. Boy--was I wrong! I once owned a four-flat in Canaryville Chicago, so believe me I know these people. Shameless has em pretty well nailed. And as a writer, I know good writing when I see it. This is it! I have never seen so many fine actors so perfectly cast for their roles. Oh yes, there's a hiccup or two. For one, I just can't see the character of Lip as a sex chick magnet, but it still seems to work. Young 12 year old Carl has inherited his Dad's (Frank's) messed up DNA. He is wonderfully portrayed by Ethan Cutkosky of St. Charles, Illinois. Carl has two main fantasies in life, guns and breasts.,Joan Cusack is a marvel every time she opens her mouth. A real treat from an actor who knows her business. William H. Macy is perfect as a modern day Fagan with no moral fiber at all but lines handed up by the writers that are perfect for his filthy unshaven mouth. (Some of the threads involving Frank can be tedious, but I forgive them.) The gay lovers Mickey & Ian steal the show especially in Seasons 4 & 5. God these are two great actors made all the better because they have good directing and really, really great dialog from the writers. Noel Fisher was born to play the closeted hood thug Mickey who falls hopelessly in love with the high school soldier boy Ian.,Yes, it is filled with nudity, sex, filthy language and adult situations. Yes some of it is very unnecessary and totally over the top. But it works. Why? Because the whole premise of the show is like a giant ghetto cartoon. It survives because it all is so totally ridiculous.,Frankly, I would never allow my teen-aged children to view this. But all in all it is one of the best series Showtime has ever produced. (And they've had some dogs.) Shameless is redeeming.",Shameless,9
Two Words - Andy Garcia!,"Fun, fun, fun movie - I'm going to see it again. So many laugh-out-loud moments. I would have loved to see more of Candice Bergen (a favorite!) and Richard Dreyfuss. Nevertheless I enjoyed the entire cast, movie and especially the music!",Book Club,8
A burst-out-laughing movie!,"Candice Bergen stole the show! The movie provided several opportunities for soda to squirt out your nose! The music was really good, but esp the Meat Ball song coordinated with the dance scene. Glad Nelson got out of his tiresome funk.
Would have loved more Dreyfus---w/ Candice. They were honestly adorable. And lastly, I wanted to put Garcia in my purse and bring him home! Cute cute cute. Lucky Keaton. Lucky lucky lucky.",Book Club,8
Living a show...not watching it! It's that real!,"This show makes you feel the hard stuff they are feeling right down to even crying or feeling guilty for anything wrong you might have done. It is a show that makes you think about life and helps you make choices. It's like the characters are doing the wrong ones so you don't have to. So sit tight, for you may feel guilty for being in prison from your own couch and then cry at the sight of freedom! The casting director is a genius man! Sheila, Lip and Fiona are a fresh breeze of new acting, while all the rest are simply delightful! All the actors in this series are excellent. Some may say that the script is exaggerated, but once you've seen 3 episodes you will soon realize it's really not! Discover for yourself why!",Shameless,10
Fifty Shades of Hilarity!,"I didn't think this movie would be anything more than mildly amusing. But, once again (just as she did in ""First Wives Club"" and ""The Family Stone""), Diane Keaton proved me wrong. And, in that regard, she had a lot of help!, The premise of the story is relatively simple. Jane Fonda plays a wealthy, cougarish hotelier; Candace Bergen plays a divorced Federal judge; Mary Steenburgen plays a married-but-under-sexed restaurateur; and Diane plays a widowed mom with two grown (and grown too overprotective) daughters. What do all four have in common? A book club that the four of them have been the sole members of since 1974. Their most recent reading material?, The ""Fifty Shades"" book trilogy by E.L. James., The effect those books have on their post-50-something love lives has to be seen to be believed...and enjoyed. And with male-co-stars like Andy Garcia, Richard Dreyfuss, Don Johnson, and Craig T. Nelson (Diane's co-star from""The Family Stone""), how could it not be enjoyed?, Assuming, of course, one is not some Millenial age-ist.,In short; I wish I could quote some of the more memorable lines that made me belly laugh. But, apparently, even substituting asterisks for certain letters of the alphabet is no longer considered acceptable by the Sealers-of-Approval at IMDB! So, just take my poetic word for it. This movie is not a waste of your money....because it is just plain undeniably _funny_!",Book Club,10
Delightful afternoon,"I along with many others went to the first show - only 12 empty seats - it was a fun way to spend the afternoon. Four great actresses paired with 4 great actors made for a good movie. Many scenes about the reality of life in what some would call the senior years. The book club of the four good friends met every month and things changes with the Fifty Shades books. And the adventures of all four were so much fun to watch - great writing with good comebacks for all the characters. It is a real movie, the four women look back at their lives and try to figure out the ways to make things more interesting. Just as their families have changed - they decide to change their own too. I would give this a 7.5 star rating - it is fun.",Book Club,8
Absolutely LOVED it !!,"So many laugh out loud moments! 
What a fantastic cast!! Seeing Jane Fonda & Candice Bergen, 2 actresses from 1960s Old Hollywood, in a film together was wonderful ! What would have been icing on the cake for me is if Ann Margret & Raquel Welch were also in it. 
It's a really great movie. If you want to laugh a lot, definitely go see Book Club. I absolutely loved it!",Book Club,10
Charming and genuinely funny,"My favorite genre of movie is ""Nancy Meyers chick flick"". Gorgeous interior decorating, lots of light, female characters that are women I hope to grow up to be, and a good dose of humor. This movie checked all my boxes. Loved it.",Book Club,8
Laughed my a$$ off,"I am no fan of Jane Fonda so I went to this movie today with a sense of obligation to take my wife who really wanted to see it. I was going to tolerate Jane and enjoy the others. ,The acting was great. Individually and otherwise. ,The four ladies were terrific together and in their scenes with their male partners, were even better. ,While the movie is a comedy it covers some serious topics not often discussed in the final quarter of life; losing a spouse, a retirement not planned out, ED, children who want to parent their parents, dating. ,I'd recommend this movie to anyone fifty or older.",Book Club,9
Great laughs,I'm always on the fence with reviews and whether or not to try a movie but I'm so glad I went to see this one! I don't understand the current rating of 6....I laughed alot at this movie and I REALLY liked it. I completely recommend it and hope it does well at the box office to show good movies are good because of script and talent. And I loved Don Johnson in this!,Book Club,8
Funny Funny Funny!!!,I haven't laugh like that hat in a really long time! It was hilarious! The four actors were amazing and what chemistry! I can't rate it high enough!!!!,Book Club,10
4 Ladies And A Book,"I really like this movie. I first saw the trailers when I went to see 50 SoG in February. I knew I had to see this. It was funny and lighthearted. I thought each lady brought something to the table for aging women. I was glad to see Candice Bergen, I think she was the one that got my attention during the first trailer I watched. The men in the movie were good fits, I've seen them all before, but Don Johnson is still VERY good looking. To talk about what I liked about the movie it was the honesty between friends that have known each other for decades. I have friends like that, some have fallen by the wayside, but my core group of friends, this would be us, if we all lived in the same location. I told my friend it will be one of those movies that I will watch over and over and over when it comes to cable.",Book Club,8
good fun,This is just a fun movie. a lot of old familiar faces. good laughs. cute story line. not an academy award winner but a good fun movie. nice escape for a couple of hours. lots of laughs.,Book Club,8
Cute n fun film.,"The lives of four lifelong friends are turned upside down after reading the infamous ""50 Shades of Grey,"" catapulting them into a series of outrageous life choices.",Book Club,10
So much fun!,"I saw this movie with a girlfriend and being women ""of a certain age,"" we could relate to most - if not all - the 4 female leads. It helped tremendously that both of us had read the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy which is heavily referenced in the movie. All I can say to anyone who is thinking of seeing the movie - GO GO GO! It's hilarious and a testament to the fantastic cast. Loved it and plan to see it again :)",Book Club,10
Laughed All Through the Movie,"Four friends, never married Jane Fonda, Candace Bergen's Divorced, Mary Steenbergen's still married but no life in her nearly forty year marriage, and Diane Keaton's widowed. But they make time once a month for their book club,As they have been friends for years and enjoy their book club. But that book ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" helps with their mundane lives heat up and change them. ,Don Johnson tries to woo Jane Fonda's character a hotel owner, Keaton is persuaded to move to AZ by her two daughters when she meets pilot Andy Garcia, Candace Bergen federal judge in trying to find dating after divorce for eighteen years, and Mary Steenbergen's character trying to find life awaken after Craig T Nelson's retirement thing.
 
Really you will get some inside jokes like with Johnson's ""Miami Vice and Fifty Shades thing"". Really the film is funny top to bottom. If you love these kinds of chick flicks.",Book Club,10
Funny enjoyable romantic movie!,"I am not sure where the low raitings are coming from. After watching the trailer I expected movie with a 3 jokes and boring storyline of some mature ladies but after the movie I was genuinely surprised and impressed how great the movie was. It was funny, there were many great jokes all the time, it was not boring at all, always something happening, the actresses were just great and super enjoyable and it was so romantic! It had a great message too that no matter what your age you can enjoy love and relationships. It's never late! If you feel like your love life doesn't work and you are just getting older the movie is for you. But the movie was for anyone at any age that how great it was done. I would see it right again that's how enjoyable it was. Worth to go!",Book Club,10
Book Club Brings a smile,"Went with a group of friends and we were expecting only 1 or 2 scenes to be funny however we were all pleasantly surprised. First of all the cast is top rate and any movie with Diane Keaton Candace Bergen and Jane Fonda in is better any movie. The movie had alot of funny moments, sweet moments and it dealt with friendships you believed. Although I do not like Craig T Nelson he was fine and Don Johnson I could do with out however the movie cast Andy Garcia who is Still Super Hot and Sexy and can I say that again Andy Garcia is Sexy and Hot, we were all talking about him.,The head of our movie club already wants to see as she said non stop laughing, one of the best movies she has been to in a long time.,As I am typing this review, another friend texted it was good to laugh and Andy Garcia wow.,This movie although not perfect is still better than most crap out there and I would take this movie over almost anything out. We need to support movies like this by that I mean light movies with actresses and actors who are older who can out act all that is out there now. Go enjoy the movie.",Book Club,10
Loved it!,Best movie I have seen in along time . Laughed all the way through it ! I'm an 80's girl so it was awesome to see so many stars from my era in one movie . You will love the characters !,Book Club,10
Love a good story you could see yourself in.,"Loved the movie. It does have thought provoking statements from the 4 main ladies. The retired age group will, perhaps, enjoy the movie because they can relate to so many of the statements.",Book Club,8
Great Actors!,This is a great movie and should be seen by everyone over 40. The younger set may learn a thing or two as well. Great acting. LOVE seeing movies made for mature adults. Now would like to see one with a lead male cast. Will definitely get the DVD the day it is released and will watch it over and over.,Book Club,10
Great movie,"I will make this really simple. Go see the movie. That is all you need to know. Is the movie predictable? Yes. But the movie is really, really funny. I read some reviews here that gave the movie a 1 or 2. They must have seen a different movie or they are really young. If you have lived a full life you will appreciate Book Club",Book Club,10
FABULOUS!!!!,I laughed out loud several times--and so did the other people in the theatre. I haven't enjoyed a movie so much since I Tonya. The ladies were all in fine form--especially Candace and Jane. It was also wonderful to see Don Johnson back again. GO SEE BOOK CLUB!!,Book Club,10
Sit back and watch as some of your favorite stars do what they do best - act!,"Producer/Writer (""A Walk in the Woods"") Bill Hoderman leaps into the Directors chair, with this star packed ensemble piece. With some of our biggest female celebrity names associated with the film (Fonda, Keaton, Bergen, Steenburgen), it would be hard to miss with this one. Luckily, writers Hoderman, along with writer/actress Erin Simms, know the books premise, know their stars strengths and are capable of presenting realistic dialogue, thus enabling the gals to shine. In addition, none of the celebs have any behind the scenes credits here, freeing all up to just act and do what they do best! Add in several terrific male supporting roles by Andy Garcia, Craig T. Lelson, Don Johnson, Richard Dreyfuss, Ed Begley Jr., and a great little role by Wallace Shawn (""Young Sheldon""), and this film has you smiling throughout. It was also great to see Alicia Silverstone (""Clueless"") back on the big screen, along with Katie Aselton (""Legion"" TV), as Keaton's uptight daughters. The book ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is the backdrop for the ""Book Club,"" giving each gal something to think about in their current and/or lack of current relationship(s). Hoderman/Simms were smart to only hint at the books erotism, without going into all the known detail, thus enabling the ladies and the film to run with the books premise. You know the actors, you've probably read one of the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" books, or scene one, two or all the movies. Now, sit back and watch as some of your favorite stars do what they do best - act! Not a fan of big ""wrap ups"" at the end of a film, this is really the only fault I can find here.",Book Club,9
Clean but naughty and you will know exactly when to laugh.,"I have seen a lot of pretty decent movies this year that are focused on senior issues. Finding Your Feet, Final Portrait and The Leisure Seeker all deal in different ways with elements of aging. Although, this movie is not quite as good or as serious, it is a fun look at how these women decide to ""Not go quietly into the night"". This is a romantic comedy that shows how a stimulating common experience can jumpstart lives that have begun to wither. The four main characters all bring remnants of their heyday and are all still attractive, talented woimen.",Book Club,6
More Entertaining Than The Average Board Game,"7/10,GAME NIGHT may not be a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definitely a genuine blast and an entertaining ride from beginning to the very end (seriously, stay for the post-credits scene!) The rare major studio comedy that actually feels like a film, rather than a soulless exercise in assembly-line filmmaking, thanks to such creative choices like Cliff Martinez's thumping score and Barry Peterson's cinematography, which not only introduces new locations as if zooming in on a board game piece, but also sports a surprisingly well-executed long take. Lamorne Morris and Billy Magnussen are some of the obvious standouts among the film's enjoyable cast of characters, but Jesse Plemons is the true MVP, stealing every single one of his scenes with ease. The film isn't without its problems, with the convoluted third act jumping the shark almost to the point of parody, and not all of the jokes land (although most do thanks to the cast's great comedic timing), but nonetheless GAME NIGHT makes for a perfectly fun time at the movies.",Game Night,7
Mainstream comedy done right,"While unlikely to ever be regarded as a classic side-splittingly hilarious comedy kingpin, Game Night is a refreshing and original mainstream experience, which is far and away the best high-profile Hollywood comedy to come our way in sometime. ,Directed by Horrible Bosses writing duo and Vacation director's John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, Game Night takes the one-time nerd only board game night to the big-time as we find ourselves a part of a games night with a difference as Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdam's game loving couple Max and Annie and their collection of friends find themselves trying to rescue Max's successful brother Brooks (played brilliantly against type by Kyle Chandler) from a real-life hostage situation. ,It's a high concept central idea and one that works thanks to Daley and Goldstein's assured and often imaginatively constructed direction and the ability for the film to both not take itself too seriously or not playing to the lowest common denominators. ,It feels like many moons since a comedy of this ilk wasn't filled with unnecessary profanities, sex jokes and loud-mouthed side characters but thankfully Game Night largely avoids these comedic pitfalls and just focuses itself on telling a genuinely good story with a large collection of jokes that work on their own merits. ,It's great to see Daley and Goldstein advance from their Horrible Bosses writing breakthrough and the relative misfire of their updating of the Vacation series as Game Night is without question the most assuredly filmed Hollywood comedy in sometime.,David Fincher himself would be proud as the duo give the film a visual flair and pizazz not often found in such genre films, from the way in which they shoot some establishing shots like a real-life board game or an eye-popping keeping's off sequence in a glamorous house, Game Night is filled with visual gems that when combined with Drive and Neon Demon composer Cliff Martinez's score, create a memorable mood and setting. ,Coinciding with Daley and Goldstein's wins is the work of the films cast. Jason Bateman is as Jason Batemany as you'd expect but surrounded by the likes of Rachel McAdams (who looks like she's never had this much fun) and a downright hilarious Jesse Plemon's as Max and Annie's super awkward and potentially serial-killer like neighbour Gary, the whole cast elevate each other's work to a level that makes you hope this isn't the last game night we will be spending with this colourful bunch. ,Final Say - ,Like any good games night, Daley and Goldstein's film provides a lot of fun, laughs and genuinely memorable times. Game Night is Hollywood comedy filmmaking done right and by avoiding the problems that have faced its recent cohorts (overlong running times, unnecessary vulgarity, annoying characters); Game Night becomes a highly recommendable night out at the movies. ,4 Fabergé egg's out of 5",Game Night,8
Jason Bateman Shines,"This hilarious gonzo comedy has a sharp script, clever direction, and an excellent cast. In Game Night, writer Mark Perez and directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein have crafted a tightly structured story with little visual tricks that turn out to be significant. That said, the movie really lives and dies by its cast, and this is a top-notch ensemble. Morris -- dependably funny on TV's New Girl -- gets laughs from his bubbling jealousy and dead-on Denzel Washington impersonation, clicking well with Bunbury. Horgan drily delivers as someone who's far too smart for her date; you'll likely wish there was more of her in the film. Magnussen is spectacularly idiotic as Ryan, which is a gift. Open-hearted blockheads are always welcome in comedies such as this, and Magnussen -- who's shown his dramatic chops in the likes of Birth of the Dragon -- hits it out of the park. Plemons' dead-eyed Gary generates big laughs by doing as little as possible. His stony ""I see you"" face and monotone delivery steal every scene he's in. (At one point, he happily invites the group into his house ... and, with a frozen smile, slowly backs into the darkness.),And as Max and Annie, Bateman and McAdams have great chemistry. Their timing together, their small reactions to each other; they really read as a couple who love each other, have a lot in common, and accept each other's quirks. Oh, and they're really funny. Bateman, as usual, is an effective straight man with subdued wit. McAdams gets to be a little wackier than usual and has some superb reaction moments. They're an appealing pair, and we're happy to follow them through this gleefully bloody comedy with a fair amount of twists and genuine laughs.",Game Night,8
Hilarious,"I went to an advance screening of this movie and loved it. I go to the movies every week and it's rare to find a comedy that is actually funny throughout the entire film. Most of them seem to show all of the funny parts in the trailer. ,Game Night is the exception. It is filled with nonstop laughs. The entire theater laughed throughout the movie. The actors are excellent, especially the always funny Jason Bateman. Rachel McAdams is hilarious. Great chemistry with all of the actors. Great plot.,If you are looking for a funny movie see Game Night.",Game Night,10
A classic comedy thriller with brilliant dialogue and memorable characters.,"""Where'd you find her? TED Talk?"",If you're game for a hilarious night at the movies, then see the black comedy Game Night. This romantic thriller is a mix of screwball comedy, Marx Brothers slapstick, and witty repartee you'll vow to go back for (about the handsomer brother: ""He's like the Mark Wahlberg to Max's Donnie!"") so you can catch at least half of the brilliant dialogue from the pen of writer Mark Perez.,Max (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Rachel McAdams) is a childless married couple who relax with friends playing highly competitive games like Scrabble and Charades. This night, however, with the return of his charming, successful brother, Brooks (Kyle Chandler), the game becomes fraught with sibling rivalry and violence that somehow never eclipses the humor. For the audience, determining what is just a game and what is real is the enjoyable endgame, and not easily solved.,The high-flying chases and quips remind me of Grant and Russell in their screwball days, throwing intellectual barbs while their lives are at stake (about a ditzy blonde guest: ""Where'd you find her? TED Talk?""). Although Bateman has cornered the market on the clueless but still sharp middle class professional with the classic slow burn, McAdams is a discovery as a robust bright partner only a little clueless but plenty savvy. Her takeoff on Amanda Plummer with the diner hostages in Pulp Fiction is priceless. ,Besides McAdams' surprise comedic chops, Jesse Plemons as the off- center, next-door cop Gary sheds his Matt Damon lookalike calling card and crafts a memorable role to prove his talent as a comic character. However, he's just another achiever in an ensemble overloaded with charm.
 
Now and then a fine film comes in this dead-zone time of year: Game Night is that one, a promise of good films to come long after Oscar has gone to hibernation.",Game Night,
We Couldn't Stop Laughing,"This movie was a hilarious surprise. They took an ensemble cast that took clever writing and made it even funnier - and not just chuckle or think ""that was a good joke"" and smile - but actually laugh out loud funny. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams had awesome chemistry and were hilarious as a couple. In fact, all of the couples worked well together and the relationships were all unique in their comedy dynamics. ,Another reviewer on here compares this to *shudder* Hot Tub Time Machine 2, and says this was full of pop culture references. All I can say to that is they must have seen a different movie or is WAY out of touch (unless a Fight Club reference is still considered pop culture). This movie's strengths come from the original jokes and spot-on delivery, and I can't remember once laughing during Hot Tub Time Machine 2, but this movie made my stomach hurt.",Game Night,10

Very enjoyable comedy romp,"This was a very enjoyable comedy. Plenty of jokes hit their mark and the audience loved it from the laughter I heard in the session. To be upfront I some advanced session tickets from the Australian distributor, won in a competition. So we all saw it for free, but if I wanted to see a good comedy this one is worth paying to watch.,The humour is good, nothing too highbrow but you won't find any crass humour here, just good fun throughout the film.,The film does have its silly moments and the twists towards the end stretch believability, but you don't really care as you don't watch this film to critique, but just to enjoy the ride for a few hours. The characters are not deep, but you quickly grow to like them all or feel sorry for them as the film flows on.,Enjoyable, good clean fun with the odd bit of blood, that is even used to humourous effect.",Game Night,7
Flat Out Not Funny,"Comedy is a hard genre to get right on screen. It is one of the most subjective kinds of films there is, and even comedies that are generally defined as being great can still fall flat for some people. That is simply the nature of the art of comedy. Unfortunately, this results in us, the consumers, not getting very many good comedies. Instead, there is an overabundance of brutally sh*tty comedies that make you dig your face into the palm of your hand and question why you wasted $10 and two hours of your time to watch this garbage. This was exactly my experience with Game Night, the new film from Vacation directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. I doubt many people were counting down the days until they could go see Game Night, nor could anyone be blamed for thinking it looked like a steaming pile of sh*t. The trailers never came across as if the film could actually be anything worthwhile. But then, the unimaginable happened. Reviews began dropping for the movie, and it suddenly was certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with an 81% critics rating. I had never intended on seeing Game Night, but after seeing the surprisingly strong reviews it was getting, I decided to go check it out. However, I have come to regret that decision. Game Night is everything I had originally thought it was going to be, from having terrible humor to cringe-worthy performances...

"Frustrating, Sleazy & Unfunny","This movie was meant to be a comedy however I don't know when and how did boring & ridiculously stupid characters make up for a solid humor. ,Every single character here was either stupid, unrealistic or just plain boring. None of them can be relatable, for something to be funny it has to be relatable and I cannot for the life of me believe that anyone over the age of 14 is going to find any of these ""adults"" relatable. In fact the punch lines are so bad, the creepy neighbor was legitimately creepy. Every other scene was cringe worthy. ,This movie made me ""cringe"" more and laugh less. It also made my blood boil at times, thanks to how stupid and sleazy the characters and the plot were. ,Skip this...",Game Night,4
Worthy of A Review,"I have been a member of IMDb for many many years now and am a big movie and TV enthusiast. That said, until now, not once have I felt the need to type up a review. ,Silicon Valley if possibly the funniest show I have seen, ever. The writing is thoughtful, with perfect comedic timing. The only word to describe the characters is awesome. They all work so well together that the comedy flows effortlessly. ,I am surprised to see that this show is coming from HBO. I would expect a show like this from Netflix but not HBO. But I must commend them because they hit this one out the park. I look forward to what I hope will be a long lasting series with many more seasons to come. ,You can see from my profile that I have been a member here for many years and have not ever written a single review, so you can be assured that what I say is true. If you haven't seen Silicon Valley you are missing out. Go check it out!",Silicon Valley,9
Abysmal,"Surely one of the worst flicks I have ever seen. I walked out of the theatre after about 20 minutes of boredom mixed with agony. Amateurish dialogue and acting. Gratuitous obscenities that are presumably supposed to sound authentic or earthy or god knows what, but instead seem self-consciously inserted with incongruous effect. I have noticed this with increasing frequency, the ""f"" word sprinkled liberally throughout the script if only to demonstrate that the code allows it. I was in the Navy for 20 years and don't remember sailors talking like this. In fact, I don't remember ever being around anyone who talked like this. Ludicrous.",Game Night,2
At what point do the jokes arrive?,"Found myself let out a couple of giggles and thats about it....perhaps its my lack of admiration for Jason Bateman, but overall the attempts at humour fall short way too often.",Game Night,3
Hilarious and Scathing,"Silicon Valley is a TV show that was much talked about even before it's debut on HBO. With the Silicon Valley now finding a Hollywood-like atmosphere in the way it's viewed, the entertainment industry's focus on Silicon Valley and it's unique lifestyle and culture is somewhat new and has yet to find it's equilibrium of representation between the reality of the innovation happening there and the bizarre, comedy ammunition that lies in some of the more eccentric aspects. Mike Judge's Silicon Valley is a damn good start. It's witty and scathing, and takes an sarcastic approach to it with an outsider's eye. Of course, Mike Judge is no outsider, having worked in Palo Alto during the late 80's, and his disdain for it's people and culture shows.,What makes the series work is that Judge is able to focus on all the small, ridiculous things that have become such an icon of the culture. From CEO's innovators with Christ-like followings, to the idea that the industry is somehow spearheaded by college dropouts, Judge wastes not time and has no problem putting every Silicon Valley cliché/reality on a pedestal for people to laugh at. As a native, I can say that the show does exaggerate a lot of things, but it also gets a lot right. If you've seen Judge's other work, then you will quickly see how well this fits in. With Beavis and Butthead, we got a critique about the stupidity and waste of a generation, with King of the Hill, we got a look at Judge's insight into Texas culture and the ideologies of an American culture trying to cope with the changes of a modern world, and here we have a completely new sub-culture that Judges dives head first into.,The show most certainly has it's falls, but I was hard pressed to find them as I was too busy laughing most of the time throughout. I may have a skewed view of the show, with me observing this through a filter of the real Silicon Valley, in all it's great and weirdness. But in general, this bites down hard in the most hilarious way on a truly unique and fairly bizarre place in the world. And you don't even have to know the technobabble being spit out. I do think HBO has another winner here.",Silicon Valley,9
Best Comedy CURRENTLY Airing on TV,"I was a little skeptical about this show at first and went into with the impression that I would try it but it would lose my interest after an episode or two. This show so far has been a wonderful surprise. Unlike some comedies that create forced, awkward situations that are only funny to the recorded laugh track that plays, I have burst out laughing from a number of scenes that have aired in the few episodes so far. It is very original, smart, has a believable story and characters and has many funny moments with quite a few scenes that will catch you off guard and you will die laughing. At first this was just a show I was DVR'ing then watching at some point during the week maybe a few days later. However the last few episodes have been great and I have been watching live while it airs because it isn't a stupid comedy, it keeps you interested with a pretty good story.",Silicon Valley,8
"Mostly silly, easy comedy that wasn't funny. Just a bad movie","I would give it less than 1 star if I could. I have no idea how people are giving this junk positive reviews. I only made it half way through the movie because people were arguing about talking in the theater and that was literally more entertaining. The same joke was pitched over and over. I had to leave before I heard another joke about being an insecure brother, or about a wife sleeping with a celebrity before they were married. It was almost as if the actors weren't even trying in some spots, I can't remember laughing at even one of the lame jokes. Jason Bateman is playing the same role he's done the last 5-6 times, and Rachel McAdams is not in the least bit funny. The script sucked and the actors for the most part sucked.",Game Night,1
"The whine of a harmonica, the shriek of laughter borne of pain...","A terrifically intense dramedy which features possibly the most realistic familial unit in TV sitcoms, not to mention a marriage between Roseanne and Dan Connor (Roseanne Barr and John Goodman) which is pin-point exact, warm and right--and feels lived in. All non-believers have to do is watch a few episodes: the timing is deceptively shaggy yet perfect, the characters believable, their predicaments immediate. Fully realized by Roseanne herself, who never let her real-life chronicles get in the way of the show. The writing is continually sharp, with dialogue that frequently evokes whole lives, such as in the episode where Roseanne sits in a coffee house after hours talking to a tired waitress who confides about her late husband, ""I miss him. It's so quiet. Sometimes I'll turn a football game on, turn it up real loud...and I hate sports. But what'ya gonna do?"" Tender moments like this, seemingly throwaway bits, elude some viewers looking for a fast laughter fix; ""Roseanne"" was always something more, and it aches in laughter and in life's woes.",Roseanne,9
This show is smart,"I really don't like other HBO Comedies like Girls and Looking. I heard about this show and I'm a programmer myself so i thought i will give it a chance and I'm not disappointed.,The pilot was great and SMART, the lines were great and performances were all terrific.,All the characters were kind of cool and i'm looking forward to see them again.

Guess it helps that I've been and have friends working in Silicon Valley... As long as you have an IT department in your business you'll be able to relate as well...,Looking forward to next week. Glad to see HBO is still putting out good shows.",Silicon Valley,10
Unfathomably bad.,"Let's forget for a moment that I predicted the outcome of the movie the moment the police officer friend entered the script. Let's forget for a moment that the jokes are so lazy, that I predicted the exact amount of cash the dumb guy was going to use for the bribe, down to the order of the notes. Let's forget for a moment that the soundtrack is inexcusably terrible and ill-fitting (Stranger Things-esque synths throughout the WHOLE movie? Why?!). Let's forget that all the characters act in ways SO FAR removed from how any normal person would, that it's entirely impossible to suspend disbelief. Let's forget the lazy jokes which consist of 90% pop culture references and 10% stupid gross-out humor. ,Let's forget all of that. ,Answer me two questions: ,1. What were the characters? 
None of the characters make a LICK of sense, nor do they have any defining traits. For example, what more do you know about the African-American couple other than that they're African-American and a couple? How does the bait-and-switch running gag with the blonde guy actually being an idiot make sense, if he's so stupid that he's actually mentally retarded, but apparently still has a fancy job? Who is the Irish woman except ""Irish woman"", and why doesn't she GET OUT THE MOMENT SHE FINDS OUT IT'S (partly) REAL? Who are McAdams and Bateman, except for non-stop quippy morons who seem unfazed by being shot and watching people die gruesomely? ,2. What was the plot? 
Seriously, I've got no idea. It was impossibly stupid, though. ,Don't give these people money. Don't pay money to see montages lazily ripped from Edgar Wright movies, used for no apparent reason. Go watch Edgar Wright movies. Go watch ANYTHING ELSE. But not this.",Game Night,2
"An amusing adults-only comedy, but no game changer.","Another adults-only comedy from the makers of Horrible Bosses, Game Night is the latest in a long line of films operating within the ordinary-people-become-embroiled-in-crime subgenre. Putting a murder-mystery game-within-a-game spin on proceedings, it's essentially David Fincher's The Game with crude humour, which is exactly as good or bad as that sounds, depending on your tastes. Writer Mark Perez and directors John Francis Daly and Jonathan Goldstein certainly don't hold back in their attempt to garner laughs. They throw everything from impersonations and horror parody to visual jokes and gross-out humour into the mix. It's hit and miss at best, but when it's funny it's really funny; a gag-inducing bullet extraction and a hilariously slow negotiation involving a dim-witted philanderer trying, and failing, to play hardball are a couple of memorable sequences almost worth the price of admission on their own. Unfortunately there are also plenty of clangers littered throughout-plus a completely misjudged subplot that tries to inject a message about growing up-that create sizeable laugh-free portions of the movie, especially in the final act. As the married couple who host the titular weekly event, Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are a hoot when playing off each other. His straight-faced quips and her bubbly/snarky barbs are an ideal match, so hopefully they share the screen again soon. As far from being a game changer as it is from being a complete dud, Game Night is an amusing diversion that'll be most enjoyed with an alcoholic beverage or two.",Game Night,6
A true and hilarious slice of life,"I must say that ""Roseanne"" has got to be by far one of my all-time favorite television sitcoms. I watched it for its entire run on ABC from 1988 to 1997, and still watch it in reruns on Nick at Nite. It was a welcome departure from most family sitcoms of the time (i.e. Full House, Family Matters, The Cosby Show). While interesting and diverse (I watched them sometimes), these shows often lacked the portrayal of the typically less than ideal realities of everyday life. ""Roseanne"" was different in that it showed, to the extent possible, people as they really are. It proved that working class people and families can make you laugh. They don't have to be rich, blond, and thin to be funny. ,Roseanne Barr plays Roseanne Conner, a hard-working, sarcastic, but lovable wife and mother who is never short of ""telling it like it is."" John Goodman plays her husband Dan Conner, tough but lovable to mom and the kids. Oldest daughter Becky is the most rebellious and loves boys. Middle child Darlene is the tomboy, and takes after Roseanne with her sarcastic wit. Youngest child DJ takes after his father. Along for the ride is Roseanne's younger unmarried sister, Jackie, played by Laurie Metcalf. While intelligent and well-meaning like Roseanne, Jackie is much more naive and gullible. Other characters include Crystal, who later marries Dan's father Ed. Roseanne and Jackie's mother Bev, the domineering, passive-aggressive guru, is a recurring character. Among many others, we also have Becky's boyfriend and later husband Mark, Darlene's boyfriend David, friend Nancy (Sandra Bernhard), and Roseanne's boss at the restaurant, Leon (Martin Mull). Jackie later gives birth to son Andy, and Roseanne and Dan have a son Jerry.,Over the years, Roseanne and Dan face many challenges that keep them on their toes. They bounce from one job to another before landing modest steady employment. Becky challenges them the most, especially when it comes to Mark. Darlene is similar when it comes to David. DJ keeps somewhat in the background in the early years, but becomes more prominent as he gets older. Jackie has many different careers and relationships, sometimes bizarre. The Conners lose more than they win, but through it all they ""get by."" This is why I enjoyed the show so much. It showed that life does not always go the way we want it to, unlike a lot of other shows, and we have to deal with this. But somehow we get by too! ,While I did not enjoy the last season as much (it was too far removed from it's original objective), it still ranks up there on my list of favorites. People of all races, ethnicities, ability levels, creeds, sizes, orientations, etc are just like us. This is how life is and truly should be!",Roseanne,
Just great,"""Roseanne"" is a milestone in TV sitcoms.  It shows a lower class family realistically and the problems and issues they face.  It dealt with (for the time) risky issues that you didn't see on TV often.  I still remember quite a stir when two separate episodes dealt with one of the girls ""becoming"" a woman and the son of the family discovering how to ""pleasure"" himself.  Also it had episodes dealing with abortion, gay characters, alcoholism, drug abuse, premarital sex, workplace and sexual harassment, how to deal with elderly parents...  None of the characters were squeaky clean or perfect...they all had huge flaws and faults.  But all of this was done with realism, great acting and a strong (if sometimes caustic) sense of humor. You saw the characters grow and change over the course of the 9 years it was on the air.  It totally fell apart during the last season (egos were going out of control on the set) and ended horribly but the previous eight seasons were just fantastic.  And the Halloween episodes were among the funniest ever done for a TV series.  Just great all around.  If you've never seen it, catch an episode or two--it's worth the effort.",Roseanne,
A brilliant newcomer,"When I first heard of the show, I wasn't very excited, thinking it would be just another lame show targeted towards any random dude, thus making it pointless.,However, as soon as I began watching the first episode, I became hooked. Being in a similar situation (minus the incubator) myself, the show was at the same time completely 'true' and hilarious. The characters are indeed the kinds you could find if you walked into some kind of startup event. ,Even though some of the jokes are taken to an extreme, it's all pretty believable, since it pretty accurately depicts the world of technology, advertising and startups.. In its own cool way.,Needless to say, I watched the rest of the available episodes that night in quick succession and I was pleasantly surprised. It is genuinely a great show. Even though it's probably more popular around the startup scene, everyone should be able to appreciate the clever humor in the episodes.,There aren't many series or films that I rate 10/10. This is one of them.",Silicon Valley,10
Avoid at all costs,"This movie is unfunny, unoriginal, unintriguing, and boring. The idea is certainly a good one, and I could have seen it being carried out well, but unfortunately the idea was given to a man who had never directed a movie before, and it shows. The direction is simply boring, only consisting of shot-reverse shot and adding nothing special to keep your interest. The script is absolutely terrible. I laughed two times throughout this entire film, and the second time I laughed was because of my embarassment at the film's attemt for humor. The acting is fine, but the actors are simply given nothing to do. This film fails both at being an action movie and a comedy and I urge you to avoid it, unless you want to spend 2 hours of your life boring yourself.",Game Night,3
One of the best tv sitcoms ever.,"Roseanne is the most dramatic comedy, without the bugging educating stuff. All the actors are great. Dialogues are real. Sure, the first seasons are better than the newer ones, but you still should see every episode with this fab family who likes to win first prize as ""white trash"". One of the only shows with the woman-wife at the center, Roseanne portrays one of the best and true mothers in tv- ever. Ever-changing, always in control Roseanne the woman has a great deal to be proud of this 9 seasons running wonderful tv sitcom.",Roseanne,10
One of the Best,"Roseanne should be considered one of the best sitcoms in television history as every classic show is a reflection of the times it represents. Roseanne has been off the air for about a decade now, and when I have a chance to watch it in syndication, I am always entertained. Even the last season, which was a disappointment, has its moments. It's also interesting to see how the characters evolved and changed over the years. I could be wrong about the following comment, but it seems somewhat obvious when Roseanne Barr was going through her divorce to Tom Arnold. Her performance on the show was more biting than usual during that particular season. Maybe it was the media, expectation, or something else. Either way, a new dimension to the show was added due to Barr's transformation (I believe it was Season 4 or 5).,What really makes Roseanne stand out and keeps it in good company with other classic sitcoms is its blending of comedy and drama, often displayed in one scene. Elementally speaking, it reminds me of All in the Family, Maude, and Good Times, shows that defined showcasing dramedy in the 70s. Also, the performances were terrific. John Goodman was outstanding and underused as Dan. I look forward to when he is on screen. Sara Gilbert delivered a consistently excellent turn as Darlene, and then there's Roseanne Barr. She made her mark and did it well. Estelle Parsons was fantastic as Beverly, and Laurie Metcalf had some scenestealing moments as Jackie. These are talented performers giving us quality television to remember, along with the writers, director(s), producers, and everyone else involved in the project. ,Anyone who finds Roseanne insulting, repugnant, and/or basically not worth watching may be missing the point of the show and the writing itself. Watch it again and really listen to the dialog. The characters are actually quite decent  they are simply not idealistic in a society that craves moral fortitude yet has difficulty maintaining a core foundation these days. Ozzie and Harriet they're not, but then again, a classic show is a reflection of the times it represents. Hence... Roseanne. The show would fair even better today with our present economy.,Thanks to ABC for giving us Roseanne. We are the richer for it!",Roseanne,9
Potential for so much better,"I just LOVE most of the characters. There is so much good stuff going on, but every episode ends the same. Here we go.

How long can this story go on? It is just far to predictable. There are only ever two different scenarios for every episode. - Either the company and everyone is multi, multi millionaires, or they have not got a pot to piddle in.",Silicon Valley,8
Great!,"Great pilot episode. I love entrepreneurship, silicon valley and that whole tech culture so I was really excited about this show. I was very impressed with it.

They aren't glorified in any way which I really like.,They really mimicked places like Google and other huge tech companies with the world of ""Hooli"" a tech company with a CEO that the whole entire company looks at like a savior, much like the obsessions people have about Larry Page, Elon Musk and Steve Jobs. ,I'm looking forward to future episodes on this one. I've never been a fan of King of the Hill but Beavis and Butthead was awesome and of course Office Space is brilliant. I think Mike Judge has another hit on his hands for sure.",Silicon Valley,9
"Fun, at times genuinely funny, and always entertaining.","A few latter twists and turns don't quite feel genuine and the film starts to confuse itself with reveals that amount to nothing other than some slight plot-holes and leaps in logic, but 'Game Night (2018)' keeps up a fast pace and is always fun even when it isn't always funny - though it is just that on multiple occasions. It manages to be extremely entertaining and is actually surprisingly well directed, with some fancy camera-work and oddly visceral fight scenes superbly solidifying its thriller elements, while it never takes its eye off its comedy roots and therefore manages to keep a smile on your face even during some of its more obvious or on-the-nose moments. Fantastically fun stuff from start to finish. 7/10",Game Night,7
Original and hilarious,"A highly original take on the tired genre of the American family sitcom. At the time, the gold standard was ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Family Ties"", both upper-middle class and completely unrealistic. ""Roseanne"" was the first high-quality sitcom since the Honeymooners to focus on working-class families. This show took the idea of the 80s family show and stood it on its ear.,It took risks and chances that other shows were afraid to take, discussing subjects like homosexuality, child abuse, alcoholism, and teenage sexuality not just as one-show ideas, but as recurring themes. And though it wasn't successful all of the time, most of the time it was hilarious. I'd rather see a show take tremendous risks and fail than take the safe course and receive middling success.,The last couple of seasons were less than stellar, and the very last season was terrible and marked the first time that Roseanne hadn't been in the top 10 (or top 20) in the ratings consistently since it started. But overall, it had the guts to change its situation every once in a while (Roseanne had, I think, ten separate jobs in nine years) to shake things up and add new elements.",Roseanne,
Refreshing and relateable,It's strange that a revived television show is a breath of fresh air from most of the crap out there. This show felt nestolgic and new at the same time. Highly enjoyable and a show most working class families can relate to.,Roseanne,10
Comedically-heavy yet Storyline-fit,"Silicon Valley is an HBO tech-series with all the typical stereotypes. An overweight stoner, an emaciated wannabe cyber-criminal, a witty Indian with characteristic accent, and the centerpiece, a gangly socially awkward CEO.,The show aims to provide an unrealistic yet overly comedic account of a startup company, aptly named 'Pied Piper, who has just created a nextgen compression algorithm. A bit campy? Yes. However, the production value and writing are on point, the acting is adequate, and the result is an entertaining collection of scenes which keeps one interested and expectant.,As the series is only a few episodes in, not much can be said about a larger picture, but so far the show is akin to various HBO blips on a similar vein. Think 'Flight of the Conchords' minus the musical, or 'Bored to Death' minus the deadpan lethargy.,That networks like HBO are under fire from online content providers like Netflix and Hulu, I appreciate the recent trend: more artistic license and less plodding predictability. ,Thumbs up for the effort as we can look forward to watching this grow!",Silicon Valley,9
Hilarious,"As a programmer and an app entrepreneur myself I absolutely liked the first 2 episodes so far. I hope this will be a great series overall. ,Btw I also like other Mike Judge's works: the Beavis & Butthead cartoon series and the Idiocracy movie.,I've never been to California and never worked for Google or Apple but I know this western IT culture pretty well, and the series makes good laugh of it. The main character should have taken 10 million :) Now the whole series will be about how he gets trampled over and over by the vultures of capitalism. Should be fun to watch.,On a side note, it's great to see movies finally catching up with the new realities of life. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - these words now play a vital role in lives of the vast share of the world's population, but movie directors have been far from these areas until now. Good work Mike, keep it coming! :)",Silicon Valley,9
Had a great time!,"This film is much funnier than the trailers and commercials make it look. In fact, I can't remember the last time I've laughed so much repeatedly.,Lots of clever lines. Good casting all around. (Jesse Plemons is even more creepily funny than he is in the the trailers, and I'm asking myself the same question I asked when I saw Peter Jackson's King Kong: Why isn't Kyle Chandler in more movies?) Also, the direction was surprisingly well-thought out for a comedy. A lot of effort clearly went into lighting, camera work, and certain set designs.,Bear in mind, I wouldn't suggest this film if you're squeamish. The film mines its humor from the characters contrasting with some dark situations. The scene with Bateman's injured arm in the trailer is more hardcore than is let on.,If you watch this, be sure to stay through the beginning of the credits. It's one of the funniest bits of the movie.",Game Night,9
Roseanne and her show - two parallel universes,"Season 1 - You can see Roseanne and the cast struggle in the first few episodes trying to get accustomed to ensemble comedy versus her stand-up routine, however the show improves very rapidly and has some great individual episodes.,Season 2 - This marks the first of the very best seasons of the series, with the acting and writing in all episodes being top-notch. A big theme in this year's show is Roseanne trying to find stable employment after she walked off of her factory job at the conclusion of season one. I especially like how this season handled the real-life issue of what happens to a person like Roseanne who has only a high school education when she loses a factory job that does not provide any experience in doing anything that another employer would find valuable.,Season 3 - Season three of Roseanne doesn't revolve around any particular overriding story arc, but the kids are definitely beginning to grow up. The late Glenn Quinn first appears as rebel and smart-mouth Mark Healey in ""Becky, Beds, and Boys"". I liked how Mark was portrayed in these early seasons when he was ""Rebel Without a Cause"" as opposed to the last three seasons when he was transformed into ""Rebel Without a Clue"". ,Season 4 - Season Four of Roseanne has some of the best individual episodes as well as the best overall storyline of any of the show's nine seasons. The season opens with the Conners having opened their motorcycle shop on their own after irresponsible friend Ziggy ran out on them at the last minute last season. This season probably does the best job of combining great comedy, hard-hitting drama, and highlighting situations that should look familiar to any member of the middle class. Although this is not the last of the good seasons of Roseanne, I would say season four is the last of the golden years of that series, and definitely worth viewing.,Season 5 - The season starts out on a very morose note that corresponds to the deep recession the country was suffering when these shows aired in 1992. Dan's motorcycle shop is failing and will have to be closed in order for him to salvage the mortgage on the Conner home. Rodbell's, the diner in the mall where Roseanne has worked for two years, is closing too, due to business in the mall being so bad. Becky elopes with boyfriend Mark and moves to Minnesota, since with the closing of Dan's shop, Mark is unemployed too, plus Becky's college fund has been depleted to pay household bills. This opens up a crevice in Becky and Dan's relationship that takes months to heal. I compliment the show for incorporating the very bad recession going on in 1992 into the storyline. However, the Conners' troubles came on very suddenly and were resolved with a very pat answer. ,Season 6 - Although this season has some excellent episodes, and overall is a five star season, we begin to see the start of some of the trends that eventually becomes the downfall of the series. It seems that this is the beginning of a trend in ""Roseanne"" where men tend to be disposable. Jackie becomes pregnant by one of Dan's coworkers - ""Fred"" - who is never even given the courtesy of a last name, and Mark, previously depicted as an independent-minded and able mechanic is now portrayed as someone who can't even make passing grades in trade school.,Season 7 - Season 7 still has enough good episodes and even some great ones for it to be worthwhile viewing, but it is definitely the beginning of the end. Roseanne begins one of the longest pregnancies in the history of television this season - thirteen months plus the time Roseanne has been pregnant before she announces the news. The whole issue of the broken romance between David and Darlene and its resolution is one of the best parts of the season. One of the worst parts of the season is the Thanksgiving episode when Roseanne's pregnancy looks like it might be in trouble. She screeches at both DJ and Dan every time they offer an opinion as if they are trying to tell her what to do instead of the possibility that they just want to comfort her and lighten the load. Jackie tires of Fred, whom she married less than a year before, and promptly disposes of him. After a few obligatory appearances in Season 8 he disappears entirely as though he had never existed in the first place.,Season 8 - This season you have to really pick through episodes full of fantasy, inane slapstick, and politically correct undertones to get to the truly good blue collar slice-of-life episodes that made up the majority of episodes in prior years. The biggest problem with season eight is that Roseanne never did fantasy episodes well during any season, and this season is full of them. It was particularly sad to see what became of the Halloween episode this year, always a Roseanne staple. Gone are the outrageous costumes and the clever pranks of previous years. They have now been replaced by a circus of the absurd and the bizarre.,Season 9 - Many people did not like the ninth season of Roseanne, but in its totality, I found it fascinating. The main problem was that it was clumsily written and directed. You have to look at this season in the context of Roseanne's actual life. By 1996, Roseanne herself had not been living a blue-collar lifestyle for over a decade. It was probably much easier for Roseanne to do something she knew - play a woman with a blue-collar background who comes into sudden wealth. Just prepare yourself for more than a few cringe-worthy moments of TV viewing.",Roseanne,9
bafflingly bad,"I am very troubled by the existence of this show. Programmed astroturfers will surely leap at the opportunity to call me ""triggered"" or whatever, but that is meaningless. Where the original was pointed and pertinent, this re-bake is thin, lazy, and goes for the cheap stupid laugh. Jokes are flat and rely on easy labels, overstating divisions and making cliche cartoons out of everyone. And how did they get John Goodman to go along? Everyone else I can believe was desperate enough, but surely he had better things to do? No? Very sad indeed. Gone is the brilliant mind that gutted the maniacal rich and their creepy DC stooges, replaced by a MAGA-hatted sneering nobody with nothing whatsoever to say. It's like a Stepford Wife version of the original, an empty-eyed lapdog where there was once great TV.,Entirely unwatchable.,
edit: wow, is there a live person editing the comments here? So many things copy-pasted multiple times, and all the obvious 10/10s: bot heaven. The abundant 1-stars are real, believe them.",Roseanne,1
Another great Mike Judge satire,"For those expecting ""Beavis and Butthead"" right out of the gate when Judge and co. created ""King of the Hill"", the audience looking for silly shock humor were surprised to find spot-on characters populating the screen that could have come from their real life. That meant plenty of younger folks tuned out... But lots of us saw it for what it was and enjoyed the hell out of it. Now, to be fair, I'm not saying ""ALL HAIL MIKE JUDGE"", especially considering that I was not a big fan of ""Extract"" and was ho-hum on ""The Goode Family."". Yet I DO have faith that Judge's work is trying to make something more thought-provoking with a good storyline than the average comedy.,As a satire, this show is smart and funny and treading ground by focusing on a microcosm of society that in itself has it's own hierarchy and character. Despite the high amount of Geeks on screen, each has a unique personality and dynamic that feeds into the overall story. Not every episode ends happily, and some have a great silver lining, leaving expectations up in the air. It's saddening that Christopher Evan Welch has passed on seeing as how great of a performer he was and key to the show's vitality. However, there is still plenty of ground to be covered by this show and I have the feeling it'll be creative, funny and spot-on, not necessarily ""SCATHING"" as some reviewers had hoped for, and look forward to enjoying any subsequent seasons.",Silicon Valley,9
Original and funny!,"Silicon Valley does something that not many comedies shows do; that is making you become emotionally invested in its storyline and characters. it consists deep underlining themes about modern day life, business and friendship whilst remaining truly hilarious! It's why I love this show so much.,It follows Richard Hendricks, a guy with a great idea; to start a tech company in Silicon Valley. He is shy and reclusive but wants to make the world a better place, he at first worked for an internet company named Hooli. On the side, he works on Pied Piper a music app and compression software. It is worked upon in a live-in start up business incubator run by entrepreneur and his friend, Erlich. After a shaky pitch to investor Peter Gregory to get funding for Pied Piper, he agrees, however unfortunately by the end of the season he dies, leaving Richard and his gang of nerdy friends and programme engineers to find investment throughout season and where do they find it? In the hands of a crazy and careless billionaire who wants the company in his vision for one reason only; to get richer and by doing this he inadvertently drives Pied Piper to almost its downfall. On top of this, they have to deal with Gavin Bellson, who runs Hooli and stole Pied Piper's algorithm to sell a similar music compression software; after a lengthy legal battle to the rights to the algorithm Gavin's reputation is compromised leaving Pied Piper safe from his competition and to find new investment. It is a long process but they never fail to keep striving for their companies success.,Silicon Valley comments and makes humour from the hardships of business and starting a company. It's characters seem simple on the surface but are complexly built; their individual dreams and passions are inspiring! Silicon valley has a strong message; no matter what happens; never give up on your dreams! Despite all of the failures and hardships Pied Piper face they never give up and keep pressing forward. All of the characters are uncharismatic and awkward and are often knocked back by those they want support from, they don't giveup or compromise any of their product. It is a truly feel-good and motivating show to watch, and definitely hilarious. :)",Silicon Valley,10
Jason Bateman is at it again!,"I expected a bit more comedy from this film, although it was worth the money to see. Jason Bateman continues to impress with his snarky but halarious humor. He makes this movie a well rounded action/adventure/comedy that takes you through the lives of 5 friends we can all relate to!",Game Night,7
Nothing's changed and that's a good thing!,I think the show is hilarious and nothing has changed and I am glad. However I would like to see what happened with David and Darlene. And I love that everyone still has the same chemistry and that Dan is still there. All the haters have no sense of humor. Glad Roseanne is back! Can't wait to see more!,Roseanne,10
The newest reboot season is trash.,She isn't the same and the rest of her family tries too hard to be the same but they aren't. It's also irritating how they push political propaganda in their first few episodes. Totally not the same show I grew up with. It's disrespectful and tasteless.,Roseanne,1
Horrible acting! Why come back? Should've stayed away!,Absolutely terrible! Why the continued revamps? Felt like I was sitting in front of a stage amongst freebie ticket holders watching a bunch of has-beens. Already deleted the series from my dvr.,Roseanne,1
Freshest Tightest Writing EVER; never-ending gut level LOLs,"Others have written far clearer synopsis, I'm just here to gush. For reference: my idea of good TV writing and taste = breaking bad, persons of interest, the good wife, Battlestar remake, better call Saul, John Oliver, the Office, Arrested Development. ,Basically...with Silicon Valley you won't have time to pause and think because the deadpan silliness and ridiculously deep funniness will just keep coming non-stop. The pacing, timing, the punchiness and energy economy - well basically everything that matters in comedy craft are executed so freaking awesome and fabulous and BRILLLLLLIANT-LY it's beyond my vocab... ,Who would think a show with some unfashionable geeks fumbling and b****ing around in their make-shift incubator suburban open plan kitchen cum office cum home with a swimming pool would be SO captivating and rotf entertaining! ,And where did these actors come from? Where have this AAA writer producer director team been all these years? Please keep them well nourished. The world needs more of this caliber of performers please thank you TV show investors.,The humor is fresh yet ageless, cutting yet human, original yet universal. Evidently there's been some serious research of the subject matter, obvious in-depth - or even insider - understanding of the techie culture and industry. Still it doesn't matter if you're into dot com start-up culture or VC courtship dramas or not; even if you're an occasional mindless Youtube surfer or online shopper or voyeur you can relate and be drawn in. ,The whole thing is so seamlessly put together, so tightly produced, the actors are SO IN THE SCENE WITH EACH OTHER...even the most absurdly irreverent and craziest lines managed to sound so logical and matter of fact, even realistic! After all that scathing sarcastic outbursts and drama queen nonsense and deadpan cynical madness there is still heart and sweetness - you'll care about the individual dilemma and where they're going and soon get sucked into binge watch mode. ,How the Silicon Valley team did it, with such consistency, I don't know. Just watch it and feel The Craft speak for itself. 11/10 if it's possible.",Silicon Valley,10
My Favourite new show !,"Wow, just an amazing show I absolutely love it. The characters specifically are funny as hell and each one brings something new to the table. Mike Judge has created a sophisticated, funny TV show that is clever and well worth a watch. I had only seen a couple of Mike Judge creations (Beavis and Butt head and Office space) before watching the show so I didn't really now what to expect but I was pleased to find that he has made the show not only an accurate depiction of the real Silicon Valley but also accessible to the masses. I was especially impressed with the character of Erlich played by TJ Miller as he is not only funny but also the way he aggravates the other members of the hacker house allows for a lot of funny scenes. I really hope the show stays around for a while as I am really enjoying it.",Silicon Valley,10
A disaster...,"Unbelievably stupid ! A movie for low IQ people ! A 7 year old would write a more interesting scenario. No, no...even a dog would write a more interesting scenario !",Game Night,1
"Same old, same old....","Due to the somewhat higher rating for this Jason Bateman comedy on IMDB I gave it another try after being disappointed in the past. This was surely my last cinema visit for a comedy of this guy. ,Once again most of the 'jokes' where totaly nonsense, like the dog-scene and the egg-around the house scene. He (and the movie) comes around like a complete idiot in this way and as a viewer I feel assaulted that I would believe this crap to happen.,Even more and more I get the idea that IMDB is flooded by fake reviewers, that's a pity.....",Game Night,3
Haven't laughed at a sitcom like that in a long time,"It's nice to see the show that pulled no punches come back and not miss a beat. They dealt with social topics while laughing at both sides, I hope they keep the series going.",Roseanne,10
One of the greatest shows on TV for a few years!,"Roseanne was one of the funniest, most original programs on television for a long time. I recommend avoiding the last few years of the show; they're so maudlin and idiotic that they seem more like a (boring/stupid/insulting--take your pick!)parody of themselves than anything else. The actors sleepwalk through their lines as if they're fully aware of how stupid and poorly-written they are, and the last episode is ironically one of the WORST half-hours on TV! (Sort of mirrors the downfall of the Simpsons, really--why can't these wonderful shows just quit while they're ahead?) For a long time, Roseanne was a sweet and realistic portrayal of many American families--fraught with strife and struggle but loving all the same.",Roseanne,
Awesome,Story is nicely crafted and loves the concepts and it clearly explains how the startup company will face the difficulties initially and how they are succeeded after all difficulties. Pied Piper is the perfect name. Compression algorithm concept is new and it is most expected one on today world to manage big data. And Play between two billionaires is showing exactly how the tech industry is as of now. Initially I'm not interested in serials.. and after watching the trailer and impressed and started watching the shows on TV. It is already planned for next season. Currently I watched the Ep:07 from season 2. And waiting for the more seasons in future.,Silicon Valley,10
"Hilarious, Intelligent and very Original","I rarely write reviews for TV shows, but considering how incredible ""Silicon Valley"" is, I felt like sharing my 2 cents on the topic. Many of the reviews for this show were after or during season 1, so i'm happy to say that the show is still amazing halfway through season 4. ,Like many other reviewers, I am a programmer myself so I have a great appreciation for the show's technical content, even if it is sometimes unrealistic (it is a comedy first and foremost, after all). While there is a variety of computer science related topics discussed on this show, you do not need a technical background at all to enjoy it's content. A lot of people I talk to seem uninterested in ""Silicon Valley"" simply because they feel like they won't understand it, but that simply isn't the case; while a background in IT/computer science will certainly help you understand some of the jargon used, it is not at all necessary to enjoy it. ,What makes this show so special is the characters; each character is hilarious in their own right and together, they make for some pretty fantastic moments (particularly the back and forth banter between the characters Dinesh and Gilfoyle). T.J. Miller is absolutely hysterical as the weed smoking Erlich Bachman and I highly doubt anyone could pull off the dialogue better than him. The writing is also very witty which definitely helps bring the characters alive. Those who follow the tech world will notice that some of the characters are archetypes of real people (i'm thinking of you, Mark Cuban) and helps bridge the gap between the fictitious world these characters operate in and the world we see around us everyday. ,I'm so glad this show has not lost it's way since the first season, and one could argue that it has gotten better as the years have progressed. The cast feeds off of each other so well, and coupled with the fantastic, intelligent writing, this may be the best comedy on TV right now (my opinion of course). If you don't know anything about computer science or IT, do not worry; it simply acts as a vehicle for the plot and in no way affects the comedy happening on screen. ,If you have not watched ""Silicon Valley"" yet, definitely give it a shot. It may not be for everyone, but I certainly think that most people will find it hilarious.",Silicon Valley,9
"Funny, but trailer has a lot of the funny moments","Game Night has a good plot, which can be rare for a true comedy movie and the acting is quality, especially from Jason Bateman and Jesse Plemons. However, it is another example of one where the funniest parts were shown in the trailer.",Game Night,6
Not great but it has a certain kind of chemical charm about it,"I'm not usually a fan of stupid in your face kind of humor, and I'm not positive at least 3-4 of the actors were basically reprising their formative roles from prior projects. But when the chemistry is there, run with it, baby. Worth a watch, even on a date night / game night, but I wouldn't spend a fortune making it happen.",Game Night,4
Don't waste your time.,"I feel so bad for John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf for being stuck in this has-beens repeat of their earlier show. Roseanne Barr was a terrible person before, (remember the disgraceful rendition of our National Anthem?), and is not any better now. This show feels like an ad campaign for the Trump Whitehouse. Some of her lines seem like they came right from a Russian Sock Puppets keyboard. ,John Goodman can do so much better. And he has, as in Treme. He was outstanding. I can't understand why he ever agreed to get back into this swill. ,And Laurie Metcalf is trying, but they make her look stupid and wimpish. She does not offset Roseanne. ,I am sorry I watched the pilot. That was 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back.",Roseanne,1
"Just not the same, pretty terrible","I guess I am one of the few that grew up loving this show, but found the new episodes/reboot terrible. ,The reboot simply does not have the same charm the old seasons do. Roseanne's acting seems entirely forced the whole first episode, which was cringeworthy. The fact that the Connors are apparently poor republicans with a conservative slant does not fit the Connors established in the first series. Apparently Dan feels the need to tell his 43 year old daughter how to deal with her body, and basically forbids her to be a surrogate mother using her own egg. Ridiculous. Goodman is a great actor, and his acting was great, but the change in character was unbelievable and doesn't fit the narrative that was established years ago. I think Sara Gilbert was spot on as Darlene, and she and her sister had great chemistry. In fact, the new reboot should have involved Darlene and her sister and aunt Jackie, and had Dan and Roseanne appear in limited episodes much like Roseanne's mother did previously. The story of a poor family trying to make it in america is now gone and replaced with constant political jabs and references to issues surrounding gender identity. ,Here we are yet again, watching them try to resurrect a show that is no longer relevant to the time period we live in rather than move forward and create something new.",Roseanne,2
"Incredibly well written, perfectly cast, next level comedy","Silicon Valley - a US TV series running on HBO already in its 3rd season. The story is about a start up company founded by a guy named Richard who works with 2 other total nerd programmers, all living together in an ""incubator"" owned by Erlich who is a total pot head. There are also other peculiar and lovely characters in the series and altogether the writing is not only hilariously fantastic and well thought of, no, every episode ends with a twist that comes as a total new surprise - even for the advanced Silicon Valley watcher - that is the bliss of it - a series so well written and played that you'll always be looking forward to the next episode, forever.",Silicon Valley,
Silicon Valley's Season 2 Keeps The Hilarious/Embarrassing Moments,"Coming from a surprising First Season, Silicon's Valley Season 2 doesn't disappoint either. The addition of new characters was a wise decision to not let the series become worn. As something already recognized in Season 1 and in this season continues is the well-done performance of the actors in creating different stereotypes of people who live in the valley, not only programmers, but businessmen and others too. In my opinion, the best additions to the Second Season were Russ Hanneman (Chris Diamantopoulos) and Pete Monahan(Matt McCoy), because when they were in the scene, they were the ones who made me laugh the most. But the one who stands out of all is Erlich Bachman(T.J. Miller), this guy is amazing.,I have some friends who have spent a time in the Silicon Valley and they said that the series does a nice job in representing the actual life there, such as the companies and incubators. The new situations which the characters have to pass through are hilarious and the mess caused by their actions is even more. The arguments between Bertram Gilfoyle(Martin Starr) and Dinesh Chugtai(Kumail Nanjiani),representing the endless fight of software guys vs hardware guys, are really comical.",Silicon Valley,9
The Trailer showcased what was coming..,"A group of friends who meet regularly for game nights find themselves trying to solve a murder mystery. Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams are great actors but the film suffers from terrible jokes like the one with the Plane, the creepy dude with the dog and basically all those terrible jokes that were in the trailer are here and their not good, the overall plot is ridiculous and most of all? It's a huge waste of talent and time. Game Night might got some great reviews in Rotten Tomatoes but it's not a good film or a good comedy in general. (0/10)",Game Night,1
Completely unnecessary and unwanted comeback!,"This show is absolutely AWFUL! Barr's acting is sub-par at best and she abuses her granddaughter frequently verbally and sometimes physically. Roseanne is a pile of trash that should never have been on the air to begin with and definitely DID NOT need to return now (or ever)! Bad acting, bad directing, and portrayals of child abuse are more than enough reason for me to rate this show one star (I'd rate it ZERO if I could)! This show needs to be taken off the air and Roseann Barr needs to be banned from ever acting again! It was truly bad form on ABC's part to bring this show back!",Roseanne,1
Flaming turd,So we start the show over but we forget Dan died and they won the lotto. So they should be rich. But they are still poor. Still a crap show.,Roseanne,1
The early season went great but falling off faar,Watching the latest season- I just have to wonder what happened? The character development of the main character Richard makes you think- how could this totally inept person create a company that is going to make a new internet? Totally unlikeable In the latest season- it's pretty painful to watch. There are things worth watching in this show but they lost a bit of their edge and they go for the obvious.,Silicon Valley,6
This Thor is Thor-some!,"Frankly, I didn't like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old ""save the world"" routines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same blueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and ridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God don't die, hurt as much and can always employ one last deus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost into an unknown territory, making it this year's best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended, but looking at the trailer it doesn't take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.,New Zealand director Taika Waititi seems like an unusual choice to helm Thor's third standalone movie. He has the indie root in him and he makes superbly smart comedies with oddles of heart, just watch What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) to see his outstanding oeuvre. Apparently, the Marvel-Disney studios have given him full reins and he went ahead and make a comedy. But how do you inject an indie comedic vibe into a superhero franchise that has not been done before?,Essentially, Waititi throws out all the cumbersome weights that hampered Thor and tells a simpler but no less cool story about a superhero trying to get back to his home to clean house. In between he gives Thor ample opportunities to be a beer-swigging beefcake, negotiate some treacherously outlandish situations and strip him off the one thing that makes him Thor, the Mjolnir. At one point, Odin even asks a defeated Thor ""What are you, the God of Hammers? "" that had me laughing till my tears rolled down.,The tone is light but no less serious, populated by so many colourful characters in a vivid world trapped in impossible situations. At first I thought the introduction of Hulk in the early trailer is a misstep, but Mark Ruffalo's casting would have been close to impossible to keep under wraps. By giving Planet Hulk comic fans a look-in would have been a better move. The repartee between Thor and Hulk/Banner is so hilarious. No less funny is also the dialogue between Thor and Loki, gone is that ""he ain't heavy, he is my brother"" vibe and this is a Thor that will give Loki a smackdown if he is out of step.,Cate Blanchett plays Thor's estranged sister with evil relish and you don't cast Jeff Goldblum without allowing him to be Goldblum. Waititi even voices a gladiator-mentor character named Korg that practically steals all the scenes he is in. Chris Hemsworth hams it up just to a safe degree and nails all the one-liners with an A+. In fact, the whole cast seems to be having fun.,Thor: Ragnarok embraces its preposterousness and swims in a pool of ridiculousness with the deadpan and self-mocking humour hitting all the bullseyes. In the midst of it all, it still manages to tell a super duper cool story of a superhero saving his people. Yet it manages to remain fresh and zip along with a zany lightning pace. What an inspired choice for a director. The risk taken will pay huge dividends. This has superb rewatch value and I already feel like buying another ticket just to catch all the one-liners one more time. This Thor is Thor-some!",Thor: Ragnarok,8
They should have named it The Deplorables...,"My wife & I watched the first couple of seasons of the original Roseanne show & enjoyed it. It was funny & well-acted & different from most sitcoms that were on in those days. But then like so may other series it started getting old really fast. Especially Roseanne Barr's screechy voice, John Goodman's belchy foghorn one-note performance & especially whiny Darlene/Sarah Gilbert.,So here we are 20 or so years later & what's changed? Not much, except for Roseanne's facelifts or whatever. She's as screechy as ever & the rest haven't improved noticeably. Why is this show so popular? Maybe the rest of us have sunk down to their level. Must be how we got the people we now have in the WH. As I said they should have called this new iteration of Roseanne ""The Deplorables"", because it's got plenty of them represented - from both sides of the political spectrum. 
1* out of 10.",Roseanne,1
A True Television Masterpiece,"I was twelve years old when ""Roseanne"" came out, and vividly remember it having such a huge impact on my family, as well as society as a whole. For the first time, middle-class families could identify with characters on a sitcom, and enjoy real life issues and problems being handled with utmost care and realism.,What made ""Roseanne"" unique was its utter lack of vanity, superficiality, and unrealistic idealism. In the age of ""The Cosby Show,"" and ""Family Ties,"" Roseanne stormed in as an overweight, screaming mother who didn't always keep her house clean, didn't pay the bills on time, didn't always have the answer, and didn't keep her sexuality hidden. From the very first episode, viewers got to see a messy house, screaming kids who don't always listen, and parents who struggle with money, menial jobs, and weight issues. Finally, a real family on television! Can you think of another show where the female lead walks around the house with an xxx-large bright pink bathrobe, rollers in her hair, and can still be taken seriously? Whatever you might think of Roseanne personally (in terms of her public behavior), she never let it effect the quality of the show. The show benefited from WONDERFUL writing, a fantastic cast, and a pitch-perfect blend of comedy and drama. The show had some incredibly funny moments, combined with profoundly touching scenes that really played well on television; the show was never sappy, and stayed true to life. In my opinion, virtually every episode during seasons one through six, with rare exceptions, played out like thirty minute masterpieces. By seasons three and four, the show had reached perfection.,Roseanne acted her heart out on this show, and got better every year. She could always deliver a sarcastic one-liner like no other, but as the show progressed she managed the dramatic scenes with perfect accuracy. She managed to infuse her strong, sarcastic exterior with an incredible dose of heart and generosity. John Goodman had exceptional chemistry with Roseanne, and turned Dan into a hard-working, loving father that we all wish we could have. Laurie Metcalf's Jackie was, perhaps, the shows most complex character, and, in my opinion, the best actor of them all. She could take even mundane lines and turn them into hysterical comedy. Metcalf turned Jackie into a cool, sympathetic character you always wanted around. The sister relationship between Roseanne and Jackie was perhaps the most realistic ever portrayed on TV.,The kids of the show were also exceptional. I remember watching Darlene when I was a kid/teenager, and thinking ""finally, a realistic depiction of a teenager."" The iconic Darlene was a tomboy, depressed at times, and certainly not your typical happy, popular, beautifully perfect character. She had many challenges, emotions, and Gilbert pulled them all off with complete ease. Darlene was a hero to anybody who felt like they didn't fit in. Becky was the whiny, spoiled brat of the bunch, played beautifully by Lecy Garonson; she never hit a false note. Sarah Chalke, on the other hand, was sub par, and really should never have been cast as a replacement. Even DJ, the youngest of the bunch, had some incredible one-liners, and managed to be completely real.,Overall, this show goes down as a masterpiece; it's exactly what a TV show should be: Hysterically funny, profound, insightful, relevant, and, above all, completely entertaining.",Roseanne,10
A pleasure for those in IT industry,"Catched this show few days ago, and after I watched Bing Bang Theory I must say I am thrilled about focus on strictly world of geeks, developers, angels and all those in the vast, yet strict world of IT industry.,I am Graphic Designer and former web developer but been worked in various IT companies and met lot of geeks and similar girls & fellas, so I am bit familiar with that showed here.,This is really great and funny show, and as it is from HBO it can't something cheap made and shallow. Actually by the third episode it becomes more and more involving. I adored how they managed humor through I believe real situations that exist in this world. I never been in USA or Silicon Valley but I believe the creator and producers did not degrade the core of it. I liked not just humor but also visual representation. For example, just some detail like T shirts with actual motives is awesome. ,To add final world, I think this is motivational show for getting new ideas in industry, if you are involving in it. I am not geek, just ordinary designer, but I see how motivational it is. I even looked on compressing algorithm myself :)",Silicon Valley,10
"Great humor, can't wait for next episodes","It's been a while since I've watched something different from the usual geeky comedies. This is an awesome short 25ish series of great humor and fun. ,The plot is simple, characters are great. I recommend it strongly to everybody as I laughed grotesquely to all the steps that needs to build a ""web giant"".,It has fun, it is smart, you will enjoy definitely if you are one of these people that read comments, search the web and are into the so called modern ""trend"" of web surfing.,It is understandable humor for everybody!",Silicon Valley,10
"Very nice jokes, very good cast","Just watched the entire season 1. It certainly looks promising. I hope next season won't continue in a similar fashion to the big bang theory, where it got totally spoilt after the lead characters started dating and the scientific jokes died out.,The characters are all pretty good, plenty of room for development. Peter Gregory will be a huge loss for the show, but lets hope that the writers can sort it out.,I also like the house they are living in and the fact that there are many scenes outside the building, which gives it a more natural feeling.,Really looking forward to next season, please don't ruin it.",Silicon Valley,5
Damn you Marvel!!!!,"Ragnarok is a neon-infused fantasy of what superhero films could look like. There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armies and a big spooky dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just a wacky movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise could have always been.,It takes a character that could have always been more and makes good on that promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm for the world. This is exactly how we should be rewarded for their fandom. There has never been a clearer example of throwing the entire kitchen sink at a single title and having every single washer and lug-nut of that porcelain mechanism land in perfect order than Ragnarok.",Thor: Ragnarok,10
"It's fun, it's fast, it's not flawless","I saw the premier last night. This is definitely the best Thor movie, but let's face it... that's not a difficult thing to achieve. ,It's fun from the beginning to the end. It's lightning fast, there aren't any dull moments at all, but it's missing a little gravitas. The Thor character has suddenly become the complete opposite of what he's always been. There's hardly any transition. The same goes for Loki. It works though, it just seems a bit off.,The supporting characters are fun. Hulk/Banner is great as always. Valkyrie, Korg, Grandmaster they are all colorful joys to watch. ,The villains however were (as always) underwhelming. Skurge, though he gets his minute in spotlight, feels wasted. Hela, though I love the way Blanchett played her, is just a ruthless powermonger. There's hardly any background or reason to some of her actions. And Surtur well, he's just a means to an end (pun intended).,Conclusion: It's good. It really is. You'll laugh, but you'll miss a little seriousness at certain moments in the movie. And like most Marvel movies, the villains don't marvel.",Thor: Ragnarok,8
Not the Roseanna I remember,I thought i would get that nostalgic feeling of watching this beloved classic but it is just politically charged and racist. Not the Roseanne i know. Its like the show completely disregarded her character that they spent years creating! I had to stop watching it at the latest episode where Roseanne is fearful of her Muslim neighbors and assumes that they're terrorists! How is this in any way funny or entertaining?! Her character has been completely ruined. Im very disappointed by this,Roseanne,2
Horrible,"Wasn't going to watch this at all, but read a review that said it was great, so gave it a shot. What a disaster. Nothing in either episode made me laugh, or even crack a smile. Laugh track was beyond annoying, mostly because IT WASN'T FUNNY. Loved the original show, but this is bad.",Roseanne,1
Most overrated series ever,"If there was a word to describe this show it would be dreadful. I was recommended to see this show by friends as it was described by them as hilarious and addictive.,However after seeing the first season I could definitely say I would never ever watch a second season. The jokes are repetitive and obvious, the receipt used to create the show as been used over and over by likewise comedy series (not saying nothing about the quality of other shows) and the plot gets really evident reaching the end.,Besides, in the beginning of the show the jokes changed between clever jokes and dirty jokes which is really good because of the balance between the target audience. Despite that, when you reach the end of the show you can only get puns and dirty jokes. For example one of the episodes revolves around a racist joke that starts as a funny way to improve the show but ends getting repetitive and irrelevant which makes that episode one of the most boring episodes ever.,Watch one episode, if you like watch the rest with your hopes down if you don't like, don't waste your time on this show.",Silicon Valley,1
Thor Wreck-narok!,"Thor: Ragnarok should be about the twilight of the Norse gods and the end of all things (or at least Marvel's version of it). It should be darker than the Dark World. It's not. In fact, it has almost nothing to do with it. But it may well be the twilight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Or it would be, if we were to stop watching such pauper productions. Marvel movies don't need to be comedies to work. In fact, they shouldn't be comedies at all. They can have elements of comedy, but that's entirely different. Many marvel heroes have a sense of humour, despite their troublesome lives; even through their hardships, they are many times portrayed as having a sense of the comic. But they are not jokers or stand up comedians. Sure, Spiderman is very funny, but his life is one of the hardest in the Marvel universe. To portray Thor, the asgardian god of thunder, as a joker or as a comedian makes no sense at all. He is one of the most sober and serious characters in the Marvel universe. He is not human, he doesn't perceive time as we do, he doesn't think about life as we do, so it makes sense that he doesn't have a sense of humour like we humans do. We could say something similar about the Grandmaster and Hella. Specially Hella. I mean, they weren't able to introduce a single moment of seriousness in the whole movie, not even in characters that shouldn't (couldn't) be laughing like mindless puppets and posing ridiculously every time they appear on screen. It would make sense if Loki was portrayed as mischievous, but that's it. And speaking of Loki, and since this is the Ragnarok after all, they completely distorted the fact that he is the father of the three agents of the destruction of the world: Hella, the wolf Fenrir and the world serpent (there's no world serpent in the movie). Marvel movies can be successful and yet sober. Captain America: Winter Soldier is probably one the best movies of the MCU and it's as sober as it gets. Iron Man (the first installment) deals with the threat of terrorism and weapons trade; it has many comic and funny moments, it's true, but it has a very serious tone underlying it. (This Tony Stark works because of Robert Downey Jr., who is amazing, but the Tony Stark from the comics is paralyzed from the waist down - it doesn't get any more serious than that). Avengers Assemble may not be as sober, but it still manages not to become a comedy show. Sure, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 was a hit, but it was a joke. It had nothing to do with the first one. It wasn't good. In fact, it was kind of a ""prequel"" for Thor:Ragnarok - for these comedy shows. And if someone thinks I'm exaggerating, just think about that moment when Matt Damon is portraying Loki in that ""theater play"". I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. It looks like a Jimmy Kimmel show!!! I'm sorry, but Taika Waitiki failed. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle failed tremendously. I really hope that Infinity War isn't a ""sequel"" to this kind of movie. If it is...please stop. Just stop with this kind of writing. Remember that we, in the audience, are not morons, and that not only kids in their early teens go to the movies. Just think about Logan or Deadpool (not a comedy show, although extremely funny). Forget the PG system, forget the money (you'll make it anyway), forget the special fx. And please, forget this Thor and forget any ideas of turning Infinity War into something like this. If not, we'll have Thanos (Thanos!!!!) cracking jokes all the time...",Thor: Ragnarok,1
Murder of character,"If the movie can't be serious about an apocalypse and just goofs around in nearly every scene then its certainly the murder of Thor as we have seen in comics. One cannot emotionally connect to absolutely anything, death of Odin or Thor losing an eye or destruction of Mjolnir or extinction of Aasgard as we know it. Movie is perfect example of killing the plot with over use of humor, jokes is on us.",Thor: Ragnarok,1
"Joke, jokes, more jokes","Was this movie a crappy comedy? Why so many people liked it so much? What was this movie about? What was the purpose of all the jokes? Is this only for kids?,Things that bothered me: Ragnarok is supposed to mean the end of the ""world"" but no one took it seriously. Hela is about to conquer the world and kill everybody let's make a little joke. A fight started, oh, please, another little joke. Thor steps on a banana and falls down, ahahaha, funny. Loki - 0 power in all the movie, 0 spells, 0 abilities, just nothing, where was his power, he was so useless and did almost nothing in all the movie. Hulk - personality of a teenage boy on steroids. Thor - so funny, oh my god, joke after joke. Is he THOR or the kid of Deadpool?,I had so high expectations but this movie targeted only the kids with all the not funny jokes.",Thor: Ragnarok,1
Way better than it has any right to be,"When I first saw a Cobra Kai trailer I thought, that's kind of neat but I bet it sucks. Boy was I wrong, it's is incredible. Johnny Lawernce (William Zabka) may have just become my favorite anti-hero EVER. He is so good at playing a down on his luck dirt bag looking for redemption. The episodes don't do anything to shock you to think ""man that was silly"" if anything they tell a great story. It takes the Karate Kid movie and spins it. I don't laugh at a lot of show, even shows I really like, but Johnny had me laughing out loud a few times with his dry mean humor. If your a Karate Kid fan this is a must watch. If your not a Karate Kid fan this is a must watch. It's such a good show, I can't believe it's done by youtube.",Cobra Kai,10
Cringe worthy,One word - Cringe worthy. Not wasting time reviewing this. Something this low level will stop itself,Roseanne,1
HOME SWEET HOME,"Just watched the premiere, and as a die hard Roseanne Fan, I was extremely excited for the reboot. It felt like the show never left. The show was ALWAYS political, so of course the new season is NO EXCEPTION to that. It was done in a way that is not one sided- which is great. In fact, Tv shows, movies, etc have always been political so I don't know why people are just now realizing this. I love the diversity of the show and its characters... and the subjects discussed so far. Much more emotion this time around. I was worried about how the new season would be, but it was great!! I'm a big fan of reboots, especially shows from my past. The next couple of episodes after the premiere were less political and still funny. I had to put my political feelings aside so I can enjoy one of my favorite shows from my childhood. My family was not the cookie cutter family that you see on most tv shows, so I could and can always relate to Roseanne. I can't wait for the rest of the season. A+++++++",Roseanne,10
Silicon Valley Worth Watching :),"I have been a member of IMDb for many many years now and am a big movie and TV enthusiast. But not a Big fan of Comedy TV series or movies , i watched less comedy movies in compare of Action, Adventure, Drama, Thriller etc.,So at the fist time i watched this TV-series, one think that attract me is , this show is about programmers, and by Profession i am a programmer too. watched all 2 seasons of Silicon Valley and its worth watching , It is understandable humor for everybody! this show is perfect in terms of comedy , a lot of fun moments in this show that i really enjoyed watching, i love the fighting of Gilfoyle and Dinesh :), Thomas Middleditch great acting skills.,I am eagerly waiting for its season 3, Lets see what they r gonna do in the next season. :)",Silicon Valley,9
Feels like a Monty Python' version of Thor,"(There might be some spoilers ahead but very vague.),I grew up with Marvel comics and Thor was always my favorite. None of the Thor movies were really up to the standard but as a huge fan I like them. Combined with other MCU movies which were getting better and better I had big hopes for the last Thor movie. ,I can't even begin to describe the disappointment. I wanted to leave the theater by the beginning of the second act. Disney effectively destroyed everything Marvel was building all these years!,I was warned by some friends that movie was terrible but still I hoped I would like something. The Story has immense potential but it was ruined beyond belief. The Ragnarok ... the ultimate doom .... and they made a joke of it!?!?!? Sir Anthony Hopkins (Hanibal Lecter) and Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) making fools out of themselves made it even worse. ,If this movie was made by someone else like the Monthy Python crew it might be fun but like this ...,I would have given it 0/10 if possible. After this movie I will certainly not going to watch Infinty Wars. Even more I will skip The Last Jedy and anything that has Disney label in the future.,This is blatant attempt to attract new fans among younger generations by appealing to their shallowness, selling them cheap tricks and distractions instead of a good story and directing.",Thor: Ragnarok,1
Outstanding!,"Real or not this movie is one hell of a journey! The story is truly serious and great, the fun moments are tons! The cinematography of action scenes is just unrealistic good. Hela is one of the best MCU villain so far! Cate Blanchett just killing in it in this role. She looks sexy, furious and also got her arc in the movie, which is big step, thinking about previous Thor movies. Hulk got so many epic moments, that I just can't count. Valkyrie fits perfectly in the ne ""Revengers"" team such a good actress. Loki is fan favourite again! Every moment with Tom Hiddleston on screen is awesome. ,The movie it's so colourful and extraordinary, so you can watch it again and again and again! The score of the movie, the intense scenes, I mean I really love this movie. Is the best one among all of the three Thor movies. Firstly because it feels like whole new story telling, and secondly it's also one of the best MCU movies. ,Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe gives us truly great movies, and like a die hard MARVEL fan I appreciate that.,I will not reveal the plot or some big details of the movie, I want you to enjoy yourself first, but you'll not be disappointed at all! Hela is epic, Odin got his role in Ragnarok and there are some HUGE details that'll lead to Infinity War and you'll lose your mind when you see them. ,MINOR SPOILER: Someone is coming!",Thor: Ragnarok,10
Very smartly written & acted - highly recommended,"I was a teen in the 80's and enjoyed watching this film - as most guys my age did. I was a little skeptical when I saw that they were making a new series that takes place 30 years after the movie ended. But once I saw the trailers - I felt like they might be on to something. After watching several episodes - I can tell you that they nailed it. This is the best show out there - anywhere. It's not over acted (or under acted). It's not corny or stupid either. It's the perfect match up of seriousness with a few goofs or references from the 80's thrown in here & there. This revival could have been a disaster but it looks like they got the perfect combo of writers, directors & actors. It's funny, because as a kid - I wanted to punch Johnny in the throat as hard as I could. But as a 40-something year old - I'm kinda rooting for him. Great job to the people responsible for making this happen - and of course it couldn't have happened without Ralph & William. Thank you!",Cobra Kai,10
Great For Karate Kid Fans From 80s and Latest Generation,"This series brought me back to my childhood and how much I loved the movies and characters growing up. It surprised how well the characters are brought up to date and now involve the younger generation. There's still a lot to be taught, and learned.",Cobra Kai,9
A true classic never goes out of style! Laughs around the table,Fantastic! I laughed hard i feel as though it was a well needed family reunion,Roseanne,10
Simply epic,"Well for what it's worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this year's MCU movies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn't like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It's explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don't fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians' movies, but certainly not in a bad way.,What makes this film so good is its associates. They're not out of place and they're not really forced in; like, it fits perfectly, man. Everything comes together so nicely. Take Hulk for example. I was thinking, ""Hulk may or may not work in this film. Could be great, could be straight out opposite."" Well, overall, I think it's a good idea that they did include Hulk - even more so when they had him appear as Bruce, rather than Hulk himself. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is by far the best one yet. Well, to me at least. Another thing I have to include is its humor. Some say it's either a little forced or it's just simply not all that funny. Well, the moments that were funny, were funny. Not much more can be said other than the fact that yeah, some stuff had me like, ""Ehh.. okay"", but for the most part, there's some solid laughs here and there.,Jeff Goldblum's role was unique, to say the least - but did kind of remind me of The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't know, he just did. Not a bad thing, but you know. If I were to comment on his character, I would have to say he's pretty good. He's not amazing, but he's an interesting part of the film and makes an okay villain (assuming you would call him that). One thing that really stood out to me and made the film even more enjoyable was its brother scenes, aka, scenes that revolve around Loki and Thor together. That was good in this film. I actually enjoyed Loki in this more than I did The Avengers. And Hemsworth is superb in the film. Not a better guy out there that could have played Thor. He was the correct, undeniable greatest choice.,There's also a very good 'cameo' like role, if you will, which does add to the movie. The film also doesn't lose its identity, meaning that even though there are other characters and whatnot, it's first and foremost a Thor film.,Here's what I didn't like (or, who I didn't like, for that matter): Hela. My reasons for disliking her character are pretty much simplistic and generic, but they're not invalid by any means- she's annoying. She's boring. That's really all I can say. I mean, there's a scene in which I do love that includes her, but it's spoiler-ish, so maybe another time...,Overall, however, a great film. Bright, colorful, funny, loads of action, good character usage, and the third act is damn good! I think this is perhaps my sixth favorite MCU film overall, overtaking Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it is still right behind: 5- Spider-Man Homecoming, 4-The Avengers, 3-Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2-Guardians of the Galaxy and 1-Captain America Civil War. Ragnarok is a terrific film though, and it's one of this year's best.,8.5/10",Thor: Ragnarok,9

A Fantastic Sequel in the Form of Series,"The skepticism of the announcement of this sequel to the Karate Kid saga is truly gone. It is clear there is a bit of a role reversal as we now see mainly through the eyes of Karate Kid bad boy Johnny Lawrence, who seeks redemption by taking in a student in the form of Miguel Diaz, which in turns inspires him to re-open the Cobra Kai dojo. As for Daniel LaRusso, it i clear that while he is a successful businessman, he is practically consumed with arrogance and does whatever he can to ensure Johnny doesn't succeed.,It is interesting to see the major changes in students Miguel from bullied to the arrogant fighter with Robby going from juvenile delinquent to a fighter with honor. Their backstories truly come into play in the series as well as finally learning more Johnny and his upbringing.,Like the original film, it is more than martial arts...it's about relationships and redemption. If you liked the Karate Kid saga, then no doubt, you must see this series ASAP!",Cobra Kai,10
"ITS SO GOOD, ITS UNBELIEVABLE","I remember watching the Karate Kid films as a kid, and I cannot express enough how impressed and surprised at the level of quality of this series. It successfully brings back the old ""feel"" of the films, while adding a new and complex storyline. It really embodies the legacy of the rivalry, and yet rebores the spirt of the films to a degree that is just unprecedented. I can't wait to see what they do in Season 2. Amazing job YouTube!",Cobra Kai,10
Most enjoyable movie for me.Thanks for giving me joy marvel.I really needed it,"Thor: Ragnarok plunges headfirst into unbridled comedy and Waititi gives his actors ample room to showcase their natural comedic talents, especially Hemsworth and Blanchett, who are rarely seen having so much fun. Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, and Ruffalo also shine, and Tessa Thompson steals scenes as Valkyrie, a hard-drinking Asgardian bounty hunter and former member of Odin's elite guard. Overall, the film benefits from its director's distinct style and measured irreverence, giving Thor a welcome boost of vitality.",Thor: Ragnarok,10
An utter blast,"Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children of the MCU, and when they're two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two haven't really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though I'm a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on board to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.,Imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is pitted against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a former ally, in a gladiatorial duel to determine whether he can travel back to Asgard and put a stop to Hela (Cate Blanchett) and her apocalyptic tendencies toward Asgardian civilisation.,It's testament to Marvel Studios that, even with Thor: Ragnarok being the seventeenth film of the MCU, they can still produce work as unique and exhilarating as they have here. Taika Waititi has worked wonders to inject the Thor solo films with such vibrancy of colours and characters, leading to Thor: Ragnarok becoming one of my favourite entries into the MCU so far.,With Waititi involved, I was expecting this film to be funny however, I was nowhere near prepared for just how funny it ended up being. Seriously guys, there are plenty of moments that caused raucous laughter from the audience, Thor and Hulk giving the Guardians of the Galaxy a run for their money as the funniest MCU heroes. It's the screenplay from Eric Pearson that should take most of the credit, along with some of the brilliant new characters we're introduced to, Korg in particular played by Waititi himself being one of the MCU's most welcome additions.,The action, of which there is plenty, is driven by the retro vibes of Mark Mothersbaugh's score and even Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, which kicks the finale into overdrive particularly well. Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography combines seamlessly with the expectedly stunning visual effects to create an almost psychedelic sense to the action sequences.,Coming to the performances, Thor: Ragnarok features a strong ensemble cast, pretty much all of them showing some fine comedy instincts at one point in the film. Chris Hemsworth leads the film with such a confident performance, matching both the cockiness and naivety of his character to great effect. Much like people say Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, I just can't imagine anyone else playing Thor.,The supporting performances make this such a special film, Mark Ruffalo doing some great work as the Hulk/Bruce Banner, keeping his place as one of the best actors within the MCU. Tom Hiddleston returns to the role of Loki and he's expectedly wicked, making it easy to see why he's such a favourite with the fans, while MCU newcomer Tessa Thompson shows plenty of potential to become a future fan favourite with a performance full of grit and fire as Valkyrie. If you're a fan of Jeff Goldblum then I'd just like to say you won't be disappointed with his performance as Grandmaster, a character just as eccentric as Goldblum himself.,I really liked Cate Blanchett as Hela, the villainess of the piece. While she may succumb to the weak villain syndrome that plagues superhero films these days, I felt that she suited the tone they were aiming for with Thor: Ragnarok. If the heroes can have some fun, why can't the villains have some as well?,Thor: Ragnarok finally gives Thor the solo film he deserves as one of the original Avengers, full of laughs and plenty of heart, the road to Avengers: Infinity War is nearly complete. I, for one, cannot wait.",Thor: Ragnarok,10
Everything You Would Hope,"It's corny, predictable, steeped in 1980's nostalgia, full of nods to the original... and those are just some of the reasons to LOVE it!

John Avildsen and Pat Morita are definitely here in spirit. Perfect for binge-watching and for transporting yourself back 30 years! :)",Cobra Kai,10
William Zabka steals the show!,"I have just this moment finished episode 10. I am literally on a massive high right now.

Why he has only been in Karate Kid and nothing much more is a mystery as this guy can act and has amazing screen presence and comedy timing.,This TV show was so good it literally makes me want to go out tomorrow and sign up for karate classes and learn Cobra Kai style.,I strongly recommend everyone watches this as this is way better than that stupid remake with Will Smiths son, better than all the sequels and to be honest better than the first Karate Kid movie was too. ,William Zabka needs to be cast in other TV roles too. He is up there with the best for TV/movie Anti-hero's; Snake Plisskan, Tyler Durdan and now after this Johnny Lawrence.",Cobra Kai,10
great experience,"""Fun"" isn't a dirty word. It's also not a word that means ""not art"" or ""lacking drama."" And the word ""funny"" likewise doesn't negate artistic integrity or drama. Anyone who thinks these words are contrary to great filmmaking or ""true art"" simply doesn't know what they're talking about, and should probably stop trying to discuss cinema. Humor, comedy, and satire not only have a long and glorious history in art and expression, they are in fact very hard to do correctly. Writing comedy and directing comedy is every bit as difficult, if not more so, than straightforward drama in many ways. And to whatever extent fun and comedy in films can also serve to purely entertain sometimes and to add levity to situations, that's not bad nor limiting of art either.,It speaks to the absurdity of modern film debate and fandom that I even need to point out such glaringly obvious, fundamental truths about storytelling, movies, and art. But such is the nature of rabid, narrow personal preference driven by bizarre loyalty to one publishing corporation over another. Fandom is always -- generally speaking -- turning everything into ""us versus them,"" but the extent to which it's devolved into outrageously uninformed and limited claims of what is or isn't ""art,"" is a newer development and a sign of the shallowness of so much of our modern discussion of cinema when it comes to genre storytelling.,Thor: Ragnarok is fun, and it's also funny. It is also dramatic, it is also terrific art, it is also the best Thor movie by a wide margin, and it is one of the best Marvel sequels released so far.If those statements or words bug you, then get over it and grow up",Thor: Ragnarok,10
Popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.,"Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series—generally the least liked within the MCU—it wouldn't be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It doesn't, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititi's comedy background is noticeably in full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy – the movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCU's funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side character made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchise's best one-liner since Chris Pratt's Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and there's plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising gladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the breathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s atmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho God of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela, Tessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome cameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting characters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesn't quite work, and the narrative-retcon work could've been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably taking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.",Thor: Ragnarok,9
Hard to Rate,"The acting was good, for the type of movie it was. The chemistry was great. I liked all of the main characters, but the writers WTF? They blamed the love interest for what the main female character was responsible for? WTF? Did I miss why everyone hated the love interest as well? I mean, sure, maybe they didn't think he was right for her, I get that, but they all seemed to actively DISLIKE him. EVERYONE in the mc's life hated him. I didn't get that at all. I actually came to write I think my third? review on this site after 10 years because I'm so confused.,Is this explained in the book or something? Did he do something other than kiss/sleep with a lot of girls?",The Kissing Booth,7
Definitely with Johnny on this one,Without giving anything away i will say based on the episodes I've seen so far I'm rooting for Johnny in this story..While he is espousing the same philosophy that he was taught as a Cobra Kai he's not teaching the way Kreese did as his students are the ones getting bullied and in fact probably would've been picked on by Johnny in his high school days but now he seems to be teaching them how to stand up for themselves...in a weird way Johnny has almost become the Miyagi of the story although he's not spouting the same kind of mantra as Mr. Miyagi...I'm just hoping his students don't end up becoming like Johnny was in high school because I'm really rooting for them...,Cobra Kai,9
Crane Kicked it out of the park,"Fantastic refreshing show. Feels like a genuine continuation of the movies with Daniel and Johnny both been plucked out of the 80s and dropped into the 21st Century. The writers have not tried to make everything politically correct which really helps to keep it fresh (Unlike Star Wars - The Last Jedi). Johnny has some brilliant one-liners which whilst really offensive add to the comedic value.,Daniel and Johnny have several layers of complexity and clearly are missing something from their lives which will be good to see develop. The new characters also add to the enjoyment. They are total opposites to the school kids in the movies. Within a few episodes you can see these develop as well.,The writers have given fans what they want without giving the story away (Again something which Star Wars - The Last Jedi) couldn't get right.,Living in the UK we don't get YouTube Red but was able to purchase each episode individually. Well worth the extra cost. Can't wait for the next season.",Cobra Kai,10
Jokes weren't misplaced,"I know some people are worried about the humour on this movie.But they used it excellently in this flick.This movie to me,is at least on the same level with Guardians of the Galaxy 1.I mean both guardians and Thor 3 made me laugh but never felt cringe or sensed any forced jokes.There were also very intense and emotional moments in this Thor movie.The fight sequences were so damn epic.When it comes to action,this movie is close to Lord of the Rings 2.They did a good job on reflecting the epicness of the Ragnarok event. The last trailer of the movie got my attention.And I made one of the best decisions of my life by watching it.,Hela,Valkyrie,Hulk,Thor,Loki,Grandmaster they all did pretty good job.Especially Hela.She was so gorgeous and menacing at the same time. Tessa Thompson kinda surprised me with her great performance btw.",Thor: Ragnarok,10
This wasn't a Thor movie at all!,"May be this is mostly targeted for children to teenage aged audiences. Humorous, colorful, C.G.I packed, with retro soundtracks. Making a comedy movie formula has worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, and Deadpool already, that doesn't mean that it has to be imposed in Thor too.,Not bad if you have cheap tickets, but don't pay extra for IMAX/3D experience (we watched in 3D).,**SPOILER ALERT AHEAD**,If it was supposed to be an (officially) funny movie, Korg was the best!!!",Thor: Ragnarok,6
Bad message for young girls,"SPOILER: Sure, at first glance the movie is cute and light. Elle and Noah are a classic girl and best friend's older brother deal, not unusual but not too sappy. But here's the real problem: Noah is extremely controlling and manipulative of Elle- before they're even dating. He orders her around and expects her to do as he says, tells her not to go to parties, threatens boys who want to date her, and gets into fights over her. There is one scene in particular where he fights someone over something they have said to Elle, and then he screams at Elle to get into his car. Is this a good relationship for young girls to be idolizing? Do we want them to think that's okay for boys to control them? Maybe we should carefully consider how our current media affects young minds in the formative stages.",The Kissing Booth,4
The fantasy of a fifteen year old girl,"If you want to experience a fifteen year old girls fantasy, this is it!! :)
For that it like it, kind of. 
The acting is even pretty good, given that the writing is clumsy.",The Kissing Booth,6
Absurdly Good,"The answer has finally come to the age old question of ""How can you introduce nuance into a cut-and-dry good-vs-evil 80's classic"" and it comes in the form of COBRA KAI.
While there are many a homage to the film(s) that spawned it, Cobra Kai makes its own name for itself by (gasp) being very well written, and introducing depth to the degree that neither Johnny nor Daniel-San is really ""the good guy"" or ""the bad guy"". They both make poor decisions, both are dealing with the traumas of their youth (which, in Danny's case, comes down to Johnny himself in many ways), and they both pass on the positive and negative experiences to their children and/or students in various ways. Danny is often motivated by petty revenge and unable to see any good in Johnny and his Cobras (and not entirely for no reason), and Johnny may be saving himself from....himself and his past and giving his students confidence, but also seems to be making them somewhat into monsters.
The show is able to balance all this thematically and do so with poignancy and humor. Unlike, say, an hour-and-a-half long movie, the show is able to burn much more slowly and spend time with its characters and their pasts to provide a tremendous amount of depth. This might even be the thing that makes Youtube Red worth paying for. I'm legitimately hyped for season 2, what the hell. (While I won't spoil the last-minute sting in the final episode, needless to say it's a biggie).,Really watch it, you'll be suprised. Hawk is indeed ourguy",Cobra Kai,10
You do Karate Kid sequel guess so. You get squished just like grape!,"Cobra Kai,They say nostalgia isn't what it used to be.
Well try telling that to the writers of this show who have managed to capture the magic of the original Karate Kid movie.
At the same time they've given the audience something fresh too.
Cobra Kai kicks off some thirty four years after the All valley Karate tournament in which Daniel Larusso took Johnny Lawrence's championship.,A TV show that on paper shouldn't really work but it does due to some nicely crafted character development, good comedic writing and perfectly placed nostalgia.
Most importantly this show stays supremely faithful to its source material and it is obvious all involved in its production have a deep fondness for the Karate Kid movies.,Both William Zabka and Ralph Macchio are fantastic at reprising their most famous roles.
Zabka in particular is excellent as an aged Johnny Lawrence.
He delivers both a heart felt performance of a broken man coupled with some hilarious comedic moments.
He brilliantly portrays the dinosaur who is still stuck in the 80's with some rather primitive views on life.
The guy doesn't even know what a Facebook is.
Things haven't gone so well for him since he took that crane kick to the face.
His relationship with his teenage son is in tatters and he struggles to make ends meet.
His decision to resurrect the Cobra Kai Karate dojo reignites his rivalry with former foe Daniel Larusso.
Cool name for a Karate dojo dude!,Cobra Kai offers much for the hardcore fan who grew up watching the original movies.
The creators of this show have stayed very faithful to the original movie. Revisits to original locations and flashbacks will bring a tear to the eye.
This show reminded me of 2006's Rocky Balboa. Another revival which also worked because of the love and affection that went into making it.
In Cobra Kai classic songs and musical score are brought back that will put a lump in the throat and will rouse the spirit.
There's plenty for a new audience to relish too.
Whilst admittedly there's a nice helping of cheese there's also a lot of heart in this show.
All characters get a journey and story arc that gives them a tremendous amount of depth.
Like Stranger Things the young cast is very good too.
The fight choreography involving them is very well staged.
A particular character named Hawk gets a most likeable journey in terms of his transformation of character.
All this down to his Cobra Kai teachings.,Cobra Kai works much better as a series rather than it being another two hour movie.
Each ten episodes are around half an hour and this allows development of both story and characters.
If I have any criticism which really I don't, then I wish the ten part season would have been a little longer. Certain characters and story arcs do seem to not be fully explored.
Hey bring on season two this will rectify my only gripe.
I for one would love to see more.",Cobra Kai,10
"Packed with Marvel references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies, Thor: Ragnarok is an absolute blast!","After a total of seventeen films in less than ten years, it's pretty safe to say that Marvel has safely established itself as a popular, successful franchise with its own identity. Known for comedy, references to its other films and comics, and epic, fun action, every Marvel film is at least enjoyable. However, there are some that peak; some that can be included in the best Marvel films - and sometimes best films in the superhero genre. Films like this are the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy - and also Thor: Ragnarok. Definitely a highlight so far in the Marvel anthology, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the best, delivering everything you want and expect with a little bit more, brimming with fun, personality and action.,Anyone who's seen director Taika Waititi's vampire-comedy mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows will likely expect his inimitable and delightful brand of humour to extend to his Marvel entry (perhaps they've learned since getting rid of Edgar Wright from Ant-Man). It's fortunate that he kept his comedy as it really delivers and fits in well with the comedic personality that Marvel has crafted itself; some of their best films are also, by no coincidence, also the funniest (something DC fails with) and Waititi has continued this trend, while keeping the laughs fresh and genuinely funny. Not that this is a out-and-out comedy - not all the jokes are intended to make you laugh out loud; but they never feel forced and all lend themselves to the personality of the film (and the franchise) and really maximise the fun we have watching the movie. After all, this is a film about a traditional Norse God as a superhero fighting alongside a big, angry, green rage monster - it's important to have fun with it!,'Fun' is certainly one of the best words to describe Thor: Ragnarok and it doesn't extend to just the laughs. Other enjoyable elements include references to the wider MCU to excite geeks and non-geeks alike. They all fit in well and seamlessly, not a shoehorned, forced reference or cameo; they all seem organic and make sense to the plot. It's delightful to see Dr Strange, even just for one scene, and to be able to spy glimpses of the Tesseract and a fake Infinity Gauntlet. These add to the rewatch value in a few years time.,The crazy, kinetic action really does extend to the whole of the film, from beginning to end, each sequence excellently choreographed. It doesn't shy away from its roots from comics as some of the fights are just as delightfully eccentric and over-the- top. Still they never cease to entertain and, more than that, some are just stunning to behold; the flashback to Valkyrie battling Hela the first time, her army atop a hoard of winged horses soaring through an orange sky only to be cut down by swords and spikes flying towards them in slow- motion. These are gorgeous scenes and Waititi and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe should be proud; the beauty of some of Zack Snyder's superhero moments, but in a good film with much more personality.,Most of this movie's joy lies in its characters though; at the end of the day, it might be funny and the action might look cool, but if we don't love the characters, we won't love the film. Back again we get the usual ensemble of returning characters - Thor, Loki, Odin and Heimdall. All are as regal, fun and charismatic as ever, Hemsworth and Hiddleston in particular; it's wonderful to see these actors develop their characters over the last few films into lovable parts in a franchise full of heroes we already love. I feel Hopkins deserved a little more screen time and a chance to get more emotional, but, ever the professional, he makes the most with what he has (and is exceptionally good as Loki pretending to be Odin). Returning characters from elsewhere in the MCU Dr Strange and Hulk also add to the delightful ensemble; it's nice to see Strange solidifying his presence in the franchise after just one film (particularly when comparing to Tony Stark having been in six so far, not including post-credit cameos). It's a relief too to finally give Hulk a decent amount of screen time and for us to get to know him as opposed to just Banner; they're two distinct characters within each other and it's about time we get to see more of everyone's favourite rage monster.,The new characters introduced in this film are all excellent worthy additions to the Marvel roster and bring a refreshing touch with them. Tessa Thompson is excellent and charismatic as kick-ass female hero Valkyrie, able to confidently stand among Thor, Hulk and Loki. Korg may not be quite the same character he is in the comics, but Waititi takes this part (who wouldn't give themselves a minor role in the MCU if they can?!) and really makes it his own, saving lots of the quirky laughs for himself. Cate Blanchett too is a particularly fantastic villain, sure to stand amongst the best Marvel villains so far, heads and shoulders above the likes of Malekith and Ronan. She's less generic, less monologue-y and never boring; able to kick ass and be just as evilly sexy as Helena Bonham-Carter was as Bellatrix (or is that just me...?). And of course there's Jeff Goldblum who's as Jeff Goldblum as he's ever been - who doesn't love that?!,Thor proves himself to be the God of Thunder and Thor: Ragnarok proves itself to be one of the Gods of Marvel, standing proud amongst the best so far. The whole movie's an absolute blast, packed with references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies. An excellent film to round off Marvel in 2017 - let's hope Black Panther keeps up this level of excellence.",Thor: Ragnarok,8
RagnaROCK!!!,"Let's get rid of this """"Aw,but the Ragnarok event in mythology has great battles, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters"""" nonsense.Cause these movies don't have to stick to the myth or comic books,100%.They should make changes for the sake of the movie.For instance,in NORSE MYTH,fenrir(the giant dog) is the son of Loki and hela is also the child of Loki. Now tell me how the hell Marvel is gonna show us Hela and Fenrir as Loki's children??Loki is already a well established and grounded character.At this point,I don't think any director/writer could change Loki's past and introduce Fenrir and Hela,as Loki's kids cause this would also bring tons of questions,plot holes and flaws.,For the sake of MCU continuity,Marvel HAD TO make changes in the Norse Myth and in the comics.,The performances of the main cast are impressive and exceptional.This movie also showed us the real ""God of Thunder"".For the first time he was extremely powerful without his hammer.That lighting streaming all over his body was pure awesomeness.,This movie is mostly targeted for everybody except for joyless,moody,edgy people who are allergic to have fun and have a boring,dull life. The CGI,fight scenes,epic battles,monsters etc..kinda remind me LOTR.,Also,when I ve read the first reviews of this,some critics were praising the soundtracks too.Wow..they were completely right this movie's soundtrack list is on the same level with GotG 1 which was perfect.,They finally gave hulk a personality.Even though he looks all big,formidable and scary,he was kinda adorable every time he talks:).So glad they finally made him talk.They really improved his CGI.The best version of Hulk in MCU.The haircut made him better too.,Tessa Thompson surprised me with her performance.I still hear some people complaining about the color of her skin.Cause she doesn't look like Valkyrie in myth.Well,she doesn't have to actually.All I care about is,her performance.And she did really good.,So put another major hit on MCU.They did it again.We have another MCU movie approved by critics and audiences.They have successful track record since 2008.,Unlike some people's petty,shallow claims,I don't think marvel is always using the same formula again and again since 2008.Cause if they fallowed that path since 2008,people wouldn't watch their movies for the past 9 years.And they definitely couldn't create the highest-grossing franchise of the planet without their major players like Fantastic 4,X-men and Spider man.",Thor: Ragnarok,10
Funny movie with wrong message,I can't say that i did not enjoy this movie. It was funny and it is difficult not to fall for Joey Kings charisma. But the movie send some wierd messages for the young crowd who is watching this. It shows the second a girl shows skin she gets attention and the boy she wants. Also it is probably one of the oldest chliches making a movie about a good girl falling for the bad guy. So all in all an okay movie if you dont think too much about it,The Kissing Booth,5
Dont know why i watched this,Its so cheesy and SO cringey that i kept face palming and rubbimg my oncoming headache away. Please dont watch this if your taste in movies is...mature??,The Kissing Booth,2
"Worth every penny, amazing.","I was a big KK fan back in the day and this ticks all the nostalgia boxes while managing to be awesome in it's own right.

Cobra Kai Never Die!!,"**Epic spoilers ahead! Read at your own risk!**,First off, if you haven't already, I highly suggest watching the original Karate Kid movie first. The sequels (so far) don't have anything to do with the series but they are great to watch! :) The first movie will give you everything you need to watch Cobra Kai because it contains a lot of flashbacks.,I haven't reviewed on IMDB in years but I had to to give Cobra Kai its due! I told people from the jump not to judge the characters from the trailer & I'm glad I was right! The acting is amazing but how they pay homage to the original movie & especially Pat Morita is what got me the most. I always knew Johnny Lawrence wasn't a bad person, just misguided. Cobra Kai is not exactly a Karate Kid sequel. The Karate Kid is about Daniel LaRusso, Cobra Kai is about Johnny Lawrence. Think of it as a continuation but from the antagonist point of view. He's still misjudged & wants to prove himself. I REALLY hope this gets a second season because there are SOOO many loose ends to wrap up & the twist ending had my jaw on the desk!!!,If you don't have YouTube Red, you can watch the first two episodes free to get a taste but I truly believe this is well worth paying for. I never had it until now but I will keep it after my free trial month.",Cobra Kai,10
Exceeded my expectations,"This movie really exceeded my expectation.For me it is already the second best comic book movie,right after Logan.,When I ve watched the both of the trailers,I ve thought Thor 3 has the best trailer in this genre so far.Trailers really met with my expectations.,You are gonna see epic showdowns just like the way you imagined.,Glad they didn't go on serious,boring mode like they did in Thor 2.Cause that movie bored me to death just like man of steel did.,Lastly,I just wanna say that Taika Watiti is pretty damn good director who can make both good stories/plots and brilliant jokes/references(just like deadpool's humor).,Thanks again for all the joy you gave me Marvel.",Thor: Ragnarok,10
Thor Ragnarok... Truly Ragnarok in all the sense of the word.,Whilst the movie was enjoyable I wasn't expecting a comedy. it is a slapstick comedy from Marvel or something that was created for school children. I know that you have to sell a product that doesn't mean you make an action movie or a hero movie Or a superhero movie do a total slapstick comedy full of puns and one-liners making me think I'm watching a 90s superhero movie with 2017 digital effects if you wanted to characterize this as a comedy and then probably I would have given in the higher score but since it was in my word superhero movies it deserves the lowest score that can be given the director was great but if this was meant to be a comedy nothing new or groundbreaking does not even compare to anything good only reason it is getting good reviews is because the rest of the movies in the box office are below par or not superhero movies. Expected a lot but was severely disappointed. Slot of missed opportunities.,Thor: Ragnarok,1
I NEED A SECOND ONE,Such a cute story and even though the guy isn't perfect and he tries to control her she doesn't let him. they help each other with their imperfections and the issues that come with their relationship. watching this movie honestly made me so happy and I would do anything to see a part two.,The Kissing Booth,10
Littered with Cliches and Teenage Delusion,"As I watched, I kept thinking that this movie had a very limited target audience. High school kids would likely relate to this, especially high school girls. Anyone older than that, would see the absurdity of everything going on and ask, ""WTF?"" 
 
 The Kissing Booth is the story of two high school best friends, Lee and Shelly (Joel Courtney and Joey King). They love to dance, according to the opening narration. This comes up later in the movie in a way that's supposed to be significant and touching, but it's actually lame and eyeroll-worthy. , The pals share an agreed upon list of friendship rules that come up sporadically throughout the story. Most of them are silly, the sort of rules you would expect from kids who are six, not 16. Rule number one is ""you tell each other your birthday wishes."" Really, that's rule number one? That's the first and most important rule of friendship? That's the level of ridiculousness this movie purports. , One day, Shelly and Lee need to create a fundraiser for a school club and decide to set up a kissing booth. All the girls want to kiss Lee's hunky older brother Noah (Jacob Elordi), all the girls including Shelly, who has developed a crush. ,As luck would have it, Noah also has feelings for Shelly, so he finagles his way into sharing a lip lock with her at the kissing booth. Their feelings for each other become clear, but, oh no, the friends have a rule against dating each other's family! Shelly and Noah must hook up in secret. ,Cue the predictable montages of the two lovebirds as they narrowly avoid getting caught by Lee and many others. It's hard to watch. Not only is it a painfully obvious and cliché storytelling tactic, it feels icky watching high school kids hook up over and over again. These aren't even the only moments that feel exploitative. ,Many scenes sexually exploit Shelly, as crowds of guys ogle her and cheer her on as she strips in the boys locker room and again later while drunk at a party. Like I said, icky. ,For some reason, there always seems to be a crowd cheering, oohing and awing at nearly every moment, which is clearly ridiculous. It's the sort of thing that only makes sense in a high school kid's fantasy. They're so self-conscious, even narcissistic, that they constantly feel that their every move is on display for the world. In this movie, that is depicted literally.,Not so coincidentally, the movie is based on a book that was written by a girl at age 15. That explains so much. Now I understand why the movie suggests that kissing is the most important thing in the world. It implies that the kissing booth changed all their lives forever, which, again, is the sort of thing that only makes sense in a high school kid's fantasy. ,Of course, learning that the story was written by a 15-year-old, does not excuse all its flaws. The movie is still mostly awful, littered with plot holes and logical blunders. ,This movie could be perfect for a high school date night, but that's about it. It's not a good movie. I would advise anyone over the age of 18 to give this a hard pass.",The Kissing Booth,
eh,Cringiest and most predictable movie I have ever watched.,The Kissing Booth,2
An Unexpected Surprise,"This was unexpected. After seeing the commercial for this back in March, I was a little hesitant on watching this. But being a big fan of the first 2 movies (and just watching the 3rd), I knew I had to watch it. I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly rewarded.,The story took liberties and it paid off. Yes, some (if not a lot) of these liberties might be considered a little cheesy, but that was the point. I found myself laughing out loud at most of them. Johnny had most these moments throughout the series, although Daniel had the biggest one (Episode 10, near the end...I won't spoil it). The flashbacks were important to story, and the story flowed better because of them. ,As for the acting... it was mainly good. There were a few over the top moments. But the main cast was, mostly, spot on. Ralph Macchio (Daniel) and William Zabke (Johnny) have both outdone themselves. I few moments here and there were bit too much for me, but all in all, they were both great. Courtney Henngeler (Amanda, Daniel's wife) and Mary Mouser (Sam, Daniel's daughter) were both flawless through out the series. The rest of the cast (mainly the younger members) all performed OK to me. There were really great moments from all, but also some really horrible moments from them too. ,In the end, it's a must see. I can't wait for Season 2",Cobra Kai,9

So Bad,"In the comics, Ragnarok killed every Asgardian, including Thor, and he was gone for years from the comics. The darkest story in Thor's history.,So of course Marvel Studios makes it a comedy.,There is nothing to this movie but jokes. It's quips, pratfall, anus jokes, Hela's kind of lame, Hulk and Thor are a comedy duo. And Thor helps Loki bring Surtur to Asgard so he can destroy it. Let me repeat that in case I wasn't clear. THOR HELPS DESTROY ASGARD AT THE END.,It's just so bad.,Some of the action was really good, but the forced humor didn't work in this movie.,At least Marvel Studios has finally admitted that comedy is their main focus.,Getting stellar reviews, of course. Because critics love the MCU and will just pretend they're masterpieces when they're not. This movie was terrible.,Critics call it ""FUUUUNNNN"". But it was just lame.,I wish I would have saved my money, or burned it. At least if I burned it I still would have wasted money but I wouldn't have sat through this.,It sets the final stage for Infinity War, which is going to be a bloated mess.",Thor: Ragnarok,

Amazing movie with great chemistry,"I absolutely loved this movie 
And for those who say its full of clichées well thats completely normal when it was first written it was a teen's rom-com maybe thats what Beth Reeckles (the author) wanted to write about or maybe thats what she liked writing about 
I say for everyone to chill out its a movie for people to enjoy",The Kissing Booth,10
"A loveable, awkward, romantic-comedy","I have read many reviews saying it was cringy and unpredictable. But I loved it. The acting and chemistry was extremely believable. I loved Elle's extremely akward character and her relationship with Lee and Noah Flynn. Sure, at sometimes it was predictable and a bit cringy but I feel like that's part of what made the film so lovable.
However I would have like to see her relationship with her family a bit more. I feel like that wasn't covered as well as other areas of the film because we had about 2 scenes with her dad, who's character I didn't really understand. But apart from that the film was an amazing awkward, romantic-comedy. Although, it did have a wonderful message at the end about individuality which I loved.",The Kissing Booth,9
Wasn't what I expected but I enjoyed it,"People say the acting is bad, that it has a bad representation of women, I disagree - to me it's a story about love, of course, but also knowing what you want, having to make an unideal decision, sure it's kinda cliched to start off with, but an enjoyable film none the less",The Kissing Booth,7
"An Intelligent, Sparkling New Television Series","SUITS is smart, sassy, clever, sophisticated, timely and immensely entertaining! The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately. ,SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact. ,The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclichéd, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit! ,Grady Harp",Suits,10
I'm still finding it hard to breathe.,"Cobra Kai is, hands down, the best series ever made. Perfectly crafted, inch by inch, to bring back the essence of the original film. This is how you do a sequel. I enjoyed every second of it.",Cobra Kai,10
Kicking the crap out of political correctness.,"This show is amazing, I can't believe the Karate Kid franchise had one more ¨kick¨ in it, but it did.,Willam Zabka is perfect as a grown up version of Johnny Lawrence, he sees these politically correct times the way most of us see it: as weakness, and he is the man that's going to rectify that.,Forget the stupid, lame and simply inferior Jaden Smith remake, forget that awful, uninspired garbage even existed, this show is the true successor to The Karate Kid.,A villain turned hero, and a hero turned into a has-been, I cannot wait for this series to be renewed.",Cobra Kai,10
Disappointing goofball comedy,"This is a goofball comedy, that contains high campery and pantomime villains, endless cheesy jokes at the expense of any real character or story development in place of any type of gravitas and epicness-ITS PERFECT.,I personally don't like it and think it is a step in the wrong direction....",Thor: Ragnarok,1
"RagnaRock, Paper, Scissors?","There are two ways one can take oneself too seriously: 1. The Twilight Saga way or 2. The Dark Knight Trilogy way. What I mean is, Twilight was silly in taking itself seriously, because seriously, it didn't have the maturity required, both because of its directors and cast, to portray the necessary emotion for the desired results of profoundness. The Dark Knight Trilogy on the other hand, is like age old whisky; Swirl, smell, sip and swallow.,Thor: Ragnarok could've taken itself seriously in the good way, but rather than doing that, it didn't take itself seriously at all, unnecessarily so, and ended up becoming a good thing still, but in a bad way. It's weird and begs the question(s); Is Marvel bending to its fans' will, or is Marvel forcing its fans to bend to its will? Is Marvel being smart and trying to revolutionize Comic Book Cinema, or stupid, and completely losing the plot?,Tension is one of storytelling's best and greatest tools, and Marvel seems to be slowly abandoning it, for another great tool, humour. However, is this Marvel's doing, or is it the fans/critics/audience? ,Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Serious, dark and amazing = $714 Million Box Office, 89% from critics and 7.8 IMDb. Guardians of the Galaxy: Colourful, silly, funny = $773 Million Box Office, 91% from critics and 8.1 IMDb. GotG beat TWS (even though TWS is a sequel, and sequels tend to do more, and, our first look at Steve after The Avengers) in every way according to numbers, but was GotG actually the better film? Batman Begins, Captain America: The First Avenger, Man of Steel and X-Men: First Class suffered similar fates.,I love dark, serious, tense. Ragnarok is not that for the most part, but it's still a good watch. There is a lot that is good about this movie, like Thor and Loki's moment in the elevator, but there is also a lot that is bad too, like the fact that for 4 years we've wondered how Thor would react to Loki's impersonation/imprisonment of Odin, and what we got left much to be desired.,I think Ragnarok took a very different approach here, and, because of Marvels appeal and reach, it maybe shaking something loose. Also, they could afford to take this route with Thor, as it is the least received franchise, so, they perhaps didn't have much to lose, and more/everything to gain.,Ragnarok being this ""light"" also, could work very well for Infinity War, as long as IW is ""hella"" dark. The contrast maybe a very welcomed surprise.,I will say this though, if Infinity War takes Ragnarok's path, it will undoubtedly, dismantle its opportunity of being a legendary classic, that has been 11 years and 18 movies in the making.,Personally I think that at this point, it may be difficult to judge any MCU film by itself, because each installment is now telling the stories of something bigger, so when you factor that in, there maybe more to what meets the eye.,Anyway, in the spirit of judging each on its own merit, Thor: Ragnarok; 7/10.",Thor: Ragnarok,7
It tries to be so good,"This movie tried to copy every successful teeny hopper movie. It even had Molly Ringwald for a few minutes. And she didn't help. 
It is one of the worst movies Netflix has put out.",The Kissing Booth,2
Surprisingly good for a Netflix movie,"Netflix really nailed it this time. So fun and entertaining! I absolutely don't agree with the ones who gave this movie a low rating! Movies like this is supposed to be cliche and predictable. That's what's makes them good! ,This is a movie that is a little heartbreaking and awkward at some point but mostly fun! Really enjoyed it. Love the story and the characters. The script is a bit poor sometimes but it doesn't make it bad. ,It's totally one of my favorite movies of all time and I have watched A LOT of movies. Trust me.
Already watched it way to many times but I can't get enough. It is so hilarious and it makes me laugh every time. Really have something extra to it. ,Just watch it and ignore the reviews with low rating! And if you don't like it, just turn it off, easy as that!",The Kissing Booth,10
i just can't wait for the movie to end while watching it,"Ok, first of all the casting was very bad, even i can act better than those people. and the main character is soooooo unlikeable. i tried really hard to like her and such but i just can't. she's just plain annoying! and the plot? it was mediocre. but BAD mediocre. don't waste your time guys.",The Kissing Booth,2
A refreshing dose of smarts and laughs,"It has been a while since I have discovered a series I truly enjoy watching. Some are way too stupid and then others are way too boring, and then some have horrible actors and the list goes on.,However, in this little gem, everything is exactly right. The script matches funny and serious, silly and smart, everything at exactly the right amounts. The actors act well. Watching this show is a generally enjoyable experience which, I think, is a lot when it comes to some recent series.,I would recommend this to anyone who likes 'House MD', 'How I Met Your Mother' and other series that are often watched to feel better after a long day.",Suits,10
Quality you can appreciate,"Patrick J. Adams & Gabriel Macht both give convincing performances in the pilot, something sure to excel even more throughout the series.,The script, acting, and quality are all flawless, as far as television goes. If you're looking to be highly entertained on Thursday night, then look no further. The subtle humor, creative plot, and enjoyable dialogue entices the viewer more with each passing moment.,If you're into legal shows that include all aspects of human nature, including compassion, then Suits is for you.,Hopefully this show continues to have the opportunity to thrive; it has definitely drawn me in and I won't miss a second of it.",Suits,10

Super Cute Movie,"I'm older, but I loved this movie! It's a super cute feel good movie. Granted it might not be the best message for young people, but people, it's fiction. And it's fun. And I loved the soundtrack. Great job on this movie and I will get the book to read as well.",The Kissing Booth,10
SO GOOD,"Okay, to be honest, i love this movie. very much. i don't care if people said its a bad movie, i still love it. 10 out of 10 for me.",The Kissing Booth,10
Ignore the ratings!,"Okay, I'm 21 years old and I went into this movie with the expectations of it being geared toward the 16 year old- 13 reasons why- watching crowd but I was VERY surprised. I truly loved how simple this movie was. The actors were filled with charisma, and although predictable, the plot was good enough that it kept me wanting to see more. All in all, It's totally a feel good and emotional, yet sweet classic high school love story that I would probably watch again and recommend to others!!",The Kissing Booth,9
Just what I was looking for,"After finishing every available episode of House, Bones, Fringe, and Prison Break, I found myself at a loss of what to watch. So as I was browsing for new TV Shows, I stumbled on this one and decided to give it a go.,I am very picky about TV series' but this one really captured me. After not expecting much, it really caught me by surprise how great this was.,It reminds me of Law & Order but with more drama and a following into the characters lives. It reminds me of ""House"" in many ways. It features a strict boss that will do anything to get the job done, and an employee willing to do anything for his boss.,It is certainly a new age show that will bring in audience from all ages from teenagers to seniors. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with this show, as many new shows have disappointed me.",Suits,9
Suits is brilliant,"Suits is a compelling legal drama set in the heart of New York City at one of the city's most successful law firms. The story is centred around the firm's best lawyer, Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht), an egotistical, uncompassionate, charmingly witty Harvard graduate who will do whatever it takes to win – ""The best closer this city has ever seen""; and his associate Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), an under-achieving compassionate genius with an eidetic memory who strikes lucky by having the opportunity to work at one of the highest profile legal firms even after being caught for attempted drug trafficking and without the required qualifications. The show follows both characters as they face different legal and personal challenges in each episode whilst maintaining the gregarious and quick-witted rapport between the two.,The show offers plenty of variety besides the law by developing the relationships of many characters inside the firm, ""Pearson Hardman"", managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), a career-minded powerful woman. Jessica must balance between her two best lawyers, a devious Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Harvey, whose relationship is filled with rivalry and playable banter, is certainly one to make you laugh. The show also follows the stories of the beautiful Rachel (Meghan Markel), a paralegal whose test anxieties are stopping her from fulfilling her ambitions of going to Harvard to study law and Donna (Sarah Rafferty) a smart, sexy secretary.,Besides the two leading characters, Suits is balanced excellently with an ensemble cast filled with intriguing relationships and an original and sharp script combined with the beautiful backdrop of New York City to make this a thoroughly enjoyable TV show which I can't help but grin ear-to-ear from start to finish and I hope it continues its high standards for seasons to come. Suits is brilliant.",Suits,10
Very well made and amazing acting!!,I wasn't sure if I'd like the show but wow me and my husband love it. We're already half way thru in one day. It's well made and I love the no good guys no bad guys aspects- they all have their issues and it makes you like both of them and I love the new characters as well. I can't wait for season 2 and I haven't even finished season one!!! Love it!!,Cobra Kai,10
Fantastic series!! H O L Y S H I E T!!!,"I also thought from the trailer that this just was gonna be another ""meh"" story. Boy was I wrong. This is great through and through, fantastic acting, writing and directing. A must see!",Cobra Kai,10
Must see Rom Com of the year!,"I absolutely loved this movie! Such a cute and fun movie that it is hard not to like. Didn't hurt that one of the main characters IS ""stupid hot"", but that is not the only reason this movie works. It is funny, sweet, engaging and just a fun movie- the music is great as well. The chemistry between Elle and Noah is off the charts and it no surprise that the actors are dating in real life. Definitely worth all the hype and I highly recommend.",The Kissing Booth,10
CAN'T STOP WATCHING!!,"As everyone else, I read about the movie coming out, but I didn't watch it. The first time I watched it I couldn't stop laughing, crying and feeling again the emotion of being in loved again, and specially with your first crush. I have seen the movies 5 times and I can't stop watching it. Every time is something new that I missed the first time. It's super funny. I like how they connect details with the movie The Breakfast Club and not only because Molly Ringwald is the mother of Noah and Lee. I loved the music, the scenery ... in conclusion EVERYTHING. I want a part 2.",The Kissing Booth,10
Worth watching past the pilot,"I am very pleasantly surprised by this show and will certainly continue to watch it. The characters are likable and, with the exception of ""Mike Ross,"" a page out of real life. I can guarantee you that there is not a single lawyer at a high power NYC law firm that didn't go to law school. Additionally, no lawyer as green as Mike would be given so much attention. Here is where I will cut the show some slack- without such deviations from the truth there would be no show.,Some reviewers liken this show to House but with lawyers. Sure, there are some common elements surrounding Harvey being cold-hearted and cocky yet excellent as his job. But this is where I want to draw the distinction: characters like Harvey actually exist in this world (minus the likability). There are charming, proud, extremely competent, rude, driven, and ruthless lawyers in every major firm in every major city. At some point it becomes a requirement of the job. Doctor House meanwhile is too much of a self-destructive train wreck for my taste.,If you want to get a glimpse into working at a high power law firm, an investment bank, or any other high stakes pressure-cooker job look no further. Keep the insane hours, lose the friendliness, and amplify the cockiness and voilà: a glimpse of reality. This show keeps the bad but throws in the good, so instead of feeling like work, the show instead feels like entertainment.",Suits,10
Good looking series,"After watching the pilot episode I was pleased from what I saw. The episode was long enough to give us a glimpse into some interesting characters. There seems to be a lot to go around with both leads social lives and how they impact the secondary characters. There Is no shortage of eye candy. I did find some of the time lines a bit of a stretch, but nothing major. I most enjoyed how the writers took the time to give good background material on just about the whole cast witch I think Is becoming so rare, knowing this info helps to get into these characters from the start. I recommend this show to viewers who like a lawyer type show with just a touch of softness.",Suits,8
10+ PAy the $9.99 for YouTubeRed!!!,"I can't say how much I dig this show! I grew up in the 80's and this show is directed towards my generation AND every one since then. It really hooks you in the first episode and you end up paying the $9.99 for YouTubeRED (FYI...WORTH IT!!!!). The show is well produced; not cheesy at all, i.e. it is professionally made. It is a pleasure (yeah, I'm using my 45 year old vocab) to see William Zabka and Ralph Macchio reprise the roles. No spoilers but you feel for both characters. I'm on episode 5 and not sure what I'm going to do after the 10 are over!",Cobra Kai,10
No mercy,"Great show, surprised Netflix didn't pick it up. Can't wait for the next season.",Cobra Kai,10
Loved It!,I know a lot of people hated the message but I didn't mind it at all. I'm all for it. It could have been much worst. World let's not have blinders on....things like this happen...people have anger issues....you fall for the wrong people...you make childish stupid mistakes. But to read comments about the lead female character attractiveness is the problem with the world today. I really enjoyed it and will watch it again. Although the message isn't great for the younger crowd....parents should be responsible for what they allow their kids to watch. But for a older person who enjoys cheese romance movies they will love this and I did.,The Kissing Booth,10
Favourite movie!,"Fav movie at the moment! The plot was funny and the actors really took their role! Love it, looking for the sequel!",The Kissing Booth,10
Hardly watchable to fans who enjoyed the intelligence and wit of Season One.,"I watch a fair amount of TV and think that I have fairly selective tastes in shows, but Suits was one of my favorite recently produced shows. The first season was bold, smart, and very polished. This is one show that definitely deserves HD. Harvey Specter was by far one of the best fictional lawyers out there. One of the best parts of the show was the focus on the ""case of the week"" idea, and all the clever dialog and intricate legal drama that came with it. The third episode with the boardroom battle over control of the car company was a kind of 'everyday-epic.' Another highlight was the inclusion of three very smart female characters: Donna, Rachel, and Jessica. Most notably, the primary characters had a powerful and flawless way about them that justified their ""it's not about caring its about winning"" attitude.,Sadly, the subsequent seasons have quickly degenerated. The smart female characters were transformed into gossipy shrews who now appear on screen just to spark inter-office drama and occasionally look good. Gone is the intricate legal maneuvering (ie crown jewel defense), replaced only with on-screen commentary on supposedly brilliant off-screen meetings or court appearances we never get to see. The witty banter has been dulled by a sheer lack of originality, such that the characters seemingly make the exact same jokes, only with different pop culture references. Worst of all, the writers (who must be high off the first season's success or the weed they purchased with the money from it) have turned all the powerful characters (Harvey, Jessica... etc) into flawed shells of former characters hardly fit for big firm life. This done of course to pander to the ""average viewer"" who tunes in to follow the lawyer version of days of our lives with pretty girls lusting after handsome men. Based on the level infighting in the firm, its a wonder how they log any billable hours at all. The only saving grace of Season 2 was Louis Litt's mostly solid character development.,The end of the second season allowed the show to reach a new low by introducing a British takeover of the firm with a host of odd new British characters (ie Louis's big eared British counterpart) thrust into the show just for simplistic comical value, which I'm sure a select group of slack-jawed simple viewers might thoroughly enjoy.,I write this review in the hope that some executive, writer or actor on the show might happen upon it, realize that their show is rapidly in decline and right the ship before even loyal viewers like myself simply tune out all together. The show achieved a lot in Season 1, but much of the acclaim was lost by way of lazy writing and lack of imagination.,Lastly, its a law show, you'd think they would cover the legal side a bit more than as a basis for Donna to bang a Brit or Rachel's dad to meet Mike.,UPDATE: This show has devolved to nothing more that a nicely filmed soap opera that has little connection to legal reality nor to intelligent discourse of any kind. I just removed it from my DVR.",Suits,2
"It follows a young adult who is struggling with his life who finds himself thrown into a job as a lawyer after he is hired by a big shot, charming 'closer.","This was an amazing show with a cast of actors who have great chemistry together. ,After setting aside the hour and a half allotted for the show, I was happy I did! ,It follows a young adult who is struggling with his life who finds himself thrown into a job as a lawyer after he is hired by a big shot, charming 'closer. ,After the pilot episode, I am hooked and look forward to seeing this show on USA every Thursday! ,As long as they keep the comedy and drama coming, I will be an avid watcher for life.",Suits,10
Fantastically done and plenty of scope for future seasons,"Unlike the resurrection of a lot of 80's era classics, this is a fantastic project that has lived up to the legacy and well done to all involved from the Showrunners, to the writers, actors who have all done a fantastic job. Seen the first two episodes free and had a smile on my face the whole time. In terms of the plot it actually feels like a logical continuation as Johnny was not fully explored following first his defeat and then his treatment in the Car Park in the Prologue of KK3 at the hands of Kreese. The Pilot itself nicely touches on how these issues from the loss of the Bedrock of his life (Instructor role in a Karate Dojo) to his High School sweetheart to the devestating impact his mentor and de facto Father figure (Sensei Kreese) abusing him so horrifically have had on him throughout his life. I like how they set up one episode from Johnny's perspective and the other from Daniel who still has demons to face concerning Kobra Kai.It is a great touch as well that the Showrunners have added the pressure both characters face in terms of family life. Lastly they have plenty of scope for future seasons which can be explored by characters such as Allie coming back on to the scene, plus Johhny's original pals as assistant Instructors perhaps and of course Johnny hasn't fully faced his Demons until Kreese reappears again. Daniel struggling without his mentor Mr Miyagi is tricky as Pat Morita passed away but I reckon some of the old characters like his Japanese GF from KK2 can perhaps be brought out to flesh out the philosophy of Sensei Daniel. Even the antagonist from KK3 who fought Daniel can be thrown in as a wild card!",Cobra Kai,10
Amazing,Couldn't have done better. Perfect balance and a perfect sequel to a great story,Cobra Kai,10
Super cute movie!,In all honesty I don't get why people are rating it 1/10 or 2/10. I loved it. Super cute story line about a thin line between friendship or falling in love with her bff's brother. Definitely recommend!,The Kissing Booth,10
I screamed at the wall while watching this movie,"I am a sucker for romance, especially teenage romance. Usually I like this kind of movies. However, this one doesn't do it for me, the sub-par acting, (in my opinion) not so attractive female lead, the lack of chemistry, the predictable plot line and the cringey as hell dialogue just made this movie a pain to watch. ,I wouldn't recommend it no.",The Kissing Booth,3
"one lawyer , one genius equals trouble .","when i first heard about this TV series i thought why bother its probably stupid ! how good could it be ? but then i thought you know ill watch the pilot and give it a shot , why not ? before i knew it my eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to end and i enjoyed it to the fullest . this show in a way reminds me of ""house MD "" a TV series with a lot of knowledge and brains and in the future will show many law cases which will be won by these guys , a top of the line lawyer named Harvey and a genius without a degree named mike who when hears anything or reads anything remembers it forever . and i strongly recommend this TV series to anybody who likes to enjoy themselves because trust me this TV series ain't boring !",Suits,9
"Started out as a brilliant, promising idea, but it declined along the seasons","I am writing this review while the series is on its fourth season, so I will try to avoid very specific spoilers for those who are about to giving it a chance. Even so, I have to refer to the development of plot lines, so if you are a beginner, perhaps it is better to stop reading.,Suits' Pilot was frankly very engaging and interesting in terms of characters and situations, bringing a new turn on ""another lawyers' series"". I loved it instantly. It was frivolous but witty and sassy, the dynamics between Mike and Harvey was magnetic, the production was elegant, and the constant threat of revealing a serious secret was a compelling argument to keep watching a show. It also had humor and certain characters (like Donna or Louis) added enriching details.,The series had a bright first season, in which Mike's ordeals and his master-disciple relationship with Harvey were at the center of the plot, and Mike's exceptional gift with memory played a fundamental part in the development of the plot line, justifying why the cheating was sustainable and why he could actually be an asset at the lawyers firm.,Suits maintained interest and quality in the second season, with other characters gradually becoming stronger and widening the plot.,But starting from the third season I started to observe a gradual decline in the plot line, and the exhaustion became conspicuous in the present, fourth season, the weakest of all so far, to the point that is has now, really, become ""yet another lawyers' show"".,Mike's exceptional abilities have completely disappeared from the action in seasons three and four, and now he has become a bland character with nothing standing him above any other ambitious young executive. Jessica's new romantic interest is utterly unbelievable and it has negatively weighed in the show. Louis has been portrayed as a clown in seasons 3 and 4, and instead of being funny, he has become anti-climactic and unbelievable. Donna's place as Harvey's ""counsellor"" has been overextended and her ""knowing things in advance"" is, in my opinion, overused as a clisé.,In short, the series had something different at the start, and it has veered into the road of losing its original allure and interest in a very noticeable way.,PD: Jessica's amazing wardrobe, though, is always a pleasure to appreciate. And yes, as others have remarked, all the female characters seem to be cut with a same stereotyped template.",Suits,7
Total Nostalgia Trip,"I really really enjoyed this movie, which was a pleasant surprise because I wasn't expecting to. It gave me all the feels of the 80s & 90s movies that definied coming of age and falling in love.,Was it cheesy? Yes, for sure! Is it real life? No way! But aren't all Teen Rom Coms supposed to be a bit of an escape? That's part of what makes them great!",The Kissing Booth,8
completely surprised!,"I saw reviews that said the film was poor,
however personally I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will be watching it again. it's comedic, emotional and sweet all at the same time. the actors have amazing chemistry and the plot is very well planned out and full of twists.
wouldn't recommend for 12 and under however.
amazing film!",The Kissing Booth,10
No substance,"I have watched all the episodes and became increasingly disenchanted with the show. Too much melodrama, not enough substance. I am a person who loves legal dramas, anything with convincing courtroom scenes. The initial premise of an unqualified lawyer with a photographic memory was interesting but this plot was quickly relegated to the back burner. Instead each show became more typically an average soap opera where the main characters were routinely thrown into conflict with each other and starting keeping secrets and telling lies to each other. This is the staple diet of any soap you care to watch and the easiest way to create tension and drama. The love affair between Rachel and Mike was juvenile and it got to the point where I would fast forward when Rachel came into view - all she did was to complain about Mike and life in general. Finally I have to say that at the end of season 2 I lost any interest in Harvey, he seemed selfish and isolated and I could not understand his position at all. He was fighting everyone and for what reason ?",Suits,5
Really?,"Sure, the genius who got kicked out for taking a test for someone else could never find another law school that could ever accept him. Ever. Uh huh.,And sure, first-year lawyers within a firm are always trying to undermine one of their own - how else to be competitive?,But then, we've always got the parents to come along and admonish the kids to get back to work: ""Jerry, have you got that Loughton case ready?"" And like the kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar, Jerry stops smiling and scurries back to his desk.,And everyone spends a huge amount of time out-snarking the next guy. After all, how are you going to make the day go by without a few awkwardly-veiled threats, criticisms, and more than a little boasting? Even mommy has to threaten to fire someone for underperformance at least once each episode.,Snark passes for wit; undercutting another passes for work; winning at all cost passes for contributing to the firm; and unrealistic interaction passes for drama.",Suits,1
Good looking cliché's bore me to death,"Suits is about a lawyer Harvey Specter, the best closer in New York who gets an apprentice, Mike Ross, a kid so intelligent who remembers not only everything, but also seems to understand everything.,So far so good.,But that's where the interesting part ends. The rest of the whole show is about cocky, faceless robots who want to be the the biggest smart-ass in the room. Even that is not so bad, but the quality of the dialogs are of a 14 year old. ,The show lacks humor. Of an adult that is. The show misses also excitement, because really everything is predictable. Every episode is almost the same, just the topic is slightly different, and different clients.,Don't see it. I did, but found myself staring at my phone or the newspaper most of the time. ""I am missing something. It has an 8.8. That's higher than Boardwalk Empire. Which is a good series."" But no I wasn't missing something. It's bad.",Suits,2
Slow Scream,"I have watched all seasons.... unfortunately.,Originally the drama was tense and fun. The bromance between Harvey and Mike was also really interesting. However, over time the sparkle disappeared and the magic of Mike's amazing memory seems to have disappeared alongside it. Instead of being fun yet tense, the show has evolved into a continuous screaming match and people panicking about mundane nonsense. Made up drama that feels too forced to be entertaining.,Live. Die. Repeat.,Every episode seems like a catastrophe for the firm or the people. They resolve this by yelling at each other or trying to be really clever. Unfortunately the clever seems to have turned into everyday unspectacular. The characters are now just bumbling ants without direction and without any capacity for passionate relationships. Even Mike and Rachel or Harvey and Donna are washed out.,Worth a watch up to about season 3. Thereafter, it turns into a slow and agonizing death of a show.",Suits,4
Too shiny... Is there anything they can't do?,"Suits does start well, although a bit clichéd. If you can ignore that, you probably can enjoy the first season. But, that's it and nothing more. It just keeps getting more shiny by every episode. You can see the pattern even from the first episode. But by the end of second season, it gets too self-inflictive and boring.,Obviously its about a law firm and we have two protagonists who are nothing less than super humans. One is a pro in the field and have a little boring troubled past and the other is a highly intelligent junkie who drops out of college but finally ends up joining the firm. We also have some more professionals in our firm and some rivals, none too strong. Every one is of a different personality but none of them have any depth. Well, the entire show doesn't have much depth. Our two protagonists are almost always way too cool for you and me or for anyone else for that matter. Well, Ross is a little less cool, but he makes up for that with his superhuman abilities.,So, who can stop them from winning every case? Of course, NONE. Remember, they are studs. All you'll be watching is the other characters scheming and whining around while our heroes crack down things and get their way.,Can't say much. I just lost interest in it. If you care for some character depth, I'd suggest you to skip this. The first couple of seasons are a bit watchable, nothing more. However, there are better shows and this might not be worth the time.",Suits,3
Hard to swallow,"The show is entertaining up to the point that it questions the viewer's intelligence.,A legendary lawyer in what's probably the most competitive city in the world takes a chance on a drug-dealing pothead, who pretends to be a Harvard educated lawyer. OK, sure, what the hay.,Except the pothead, Mike, can't get his excrement together. He can't even *look* like a lawyer, which could be easily done by getting a decent suit and stopping riding that ridiculous bike. Sorry, but in New York City lawyers working at top firms don't ride bikes to work, especially not with messenger bags slung across their chests. He looks like a frat boy working as a bike messenger.,Then Mike starts messing up left and right. He has no sense of professionalism and his boss as well as the managing partner of the firm - seriously - keep putting their butts on the line for him. That simply would not happen. And every time Mike messes up big his superiors threaten to fire him but instead of firing him they keep giving him more chances and letting him handle/interfere in high profile cases.,Mike's unlikable and arrogant, and I just keep hoping he'll get hit by a truck and die. By the second season Mike, the pot smoker who used to get paid to cheat on college entrance exams for other people, the guy who kissed his best friend's girlfriend, the same one who sleeps with a married woman etc. etc., starts his right/wrong tirades, believing he's doing the right thing by betraying client privilege when he shares confidential information with the prosecution. And his top dog boss still doesn't fire the guy.,Like, no.",Suits,4
From a decent start to a downward spiral. There is simply no way this show is an 8.8!,"Although it had an 8.8 rating on IMDb, I was very skeptical of Suits at first. It looked like one of those shows where everyone is young, good looking, successful, and full of witty comebacks. You know, one of those shows that look kind of like, well, every other show out there. Admittedly it was with a bit of surprise that I found myself enjoying the first season. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was certainly an enjoyable show. I expected that after the solid first season that the show would only improve.,Instead, Suits fell into a downward spiral. Season 2 continued to play on season one's successes but also took it's first steps towards becoming that ""just another contrived show full of good looking people making witty comebacks"" show. By season 3 logic seemed to go out the window as the show turned cheesy and downgraded central characters to buffoonery. The show was becoming something of a soap opera. The show came to revolve around who said what to who when, how they said it, and who is lying to who. Characters became stuck in one dimension. Plots seemed to repeat only with new characters (all young, good looking and unbelievably successful, of course).,Cue season 4. In season 4 the downward spiral fell to new depths. The show no longer seems to be about the trials and tribulations of Mike Ross, but almost entirely about sappy romances, office gossip, and petty grudges. To be more blunt, the show has declined into a preteen drama. If you are a clingy 14-year old girl who wants to gossip to your friends about what Donna heard Rachel say to Mike about Harvey it might be intriguing (no offense to all the 14-year old girls out there) but compared to what the show used to be, it is a disaster. I find myself skipping entire scenes because they are simply annoying. What may be even sadder is that I spend a good chunk of the other scenes on my phone looking up things on Google. I just don't care how about who is lying to who or about how long characters can keep their relationship a secret at work. It's lame, and it isn't what made Suits a good show when it started.,All in all, there is no way that this show (all seasons accounted for) deserves an 8.8. Not even close. Really, watch other 8.8 shows like Boardwalk Empire, The Shield, Six Feet Under, Homeland and Dexter and then tell me that this show should be rated anywhere near them. Season 1 may have been an 8 (or so) but honestly by season 4 the show has declined to a 3 or a 4.",Suits,6
Same story over and over again,"When I started the series, I enjoyed suits and would probably give it an 8.I quickly realized that it fell into a cycle that was unbreakable :The same things seem to happen over and over again . It just becomes so repetitive that the "" new "" narratives just aren't interesting enough to satisfy you as the viewer.They also seem to exaggerate quite a bit at times so it really does not feel realistic at all.",Suits,3
Awesome start but lost steam after wards,"I was recommended this series by a friend of mine. I must say he was not wrong in recommending, well at least initially.,But season two onwards the show has been more about office politics and less about lawsuits. I kept on thinking the show would come back to its core theme in a while but it never did.,While it does make a compelling thriller I think all those who would want to watch the real lawsuits are not going to like the season 2 and 3 much,I am not aware of any of you have watched Boston Legal. But in my opinion it is the best series when it comes to lawsuits. It covers wide array of topics from socio-political to corporate lawsuits and has been one of the most impressive series ever. I love suits and feel very sorry to say it does even get close to the Boston Legal - the masterpiece..",Suits,5
"Another fast-paced, unrealistic legal drama ""based"" in New York (yawn)","I thought that Suits might be something of a mix between The Good Wife and Damages while being primarily about men (because women don't really wear ""suits"") but I was disappointed to learn that it was none of the above (other than just a show about men who wear suits and 'powerful' women who only wear revealing dresses). The characters are unsympathetic and the plot is all-too mainstream. Frankly, it has been done before (like in the late 90s).,In the world of Suits, a young rebellious genius without a law degree (he was expelled from college) is hired to be a lawyer at a prestigious law firm that ""only hires Harvard graduates"". Seriously? Give me a break. This is the first problem with the show: unrealistic, unimaginable, and yet overly pretentious all at once.,While it is ""based"" in New York, the scenes are clearly shot in Toronto (Second Cups in the background, and a row of yellow taxis lined up on Bay Street, as if taxis in NYC just hang around outside of office buildings in the financial district). I find the show cheesy to put it simply, and somewhat of a wannabee in the legal drama genre.,I generally agree with the majority view on IMDb (for the most part, broadly speaking) but the ratings for Suits are off the charts and I have no idea why! Am I missing something? Suits is not a high quality show. Have a closer look for yourself and see what you think.",Suits,3
a crisp new show that's sure to entertain,"By chance and luck, Mike Ross is saved in the nick of time by a lawyer one night during an escape from a shady marijuana dealing that had gone wrong. Harvey Specter, renowned as one of the top lawyers in the city, is in the midst pf recruiting for the ""right"" law associate. ,Coincidentally, Mike is faced abruptly by this job opportunity that is definitely able to bestow him the money he urgently needs to cover up for his grandmother's medical funds. Facing a major life-changing decision, Mike decides to go for it instead of partaking in illicit activities for the rest of his life. Mike affirms he makes the appropriate position for Specter, and manages to impress Specter with his deftness in retentive memorization. However, having no genuine degree from Harvard, needless to say any formal college degree, lingers as an ever-present issue. Realizing no other man Specter had interviewed so far possessed the same sense of intelligence quite like Ross, Specter is willing to cover up for Ross and his background to land him the job as his associate.,I am fairly pleased to see this new show making its way into a hit television series. It's been time they've come up with something new since Law & Order.",Suits,8
What a pleasant surprise,"I had no expectations for iZombie, but I've already watched the pilot three times. The story was good, the cast was great, and Rose McIver was stellar! My wife likened her to Buffy. I replied that she was kind of a zombie version of The Listener (another great show, btw), and a funny one at that! Malcolm Goodwin and Rahul Kohli were also instantly likable. Their characters each held up his end extremely well against the riveting presence of McIver/Moore And what a great idea to have Liv gain her insights by eating the brains of the deceased - her instant command of Romanian was hilarious. I look forward to seeing what other quirks the writers come up with for her.,This show apparently played to a decent sized audience, but it deserves so much more, and perhaps the reviews here will lead people to check this one out. I think when they do, they'll be hooked.",iZombie,10
Keeps getting better,"This has become my favorite regular show on the main networks.  The stories are good enough to keep me watching and the character interplay can be quite amusing at times.  Gibbs is great...watching the others react to him makes me chuckle.  Abby is perfectly believable, despite the goth overtones...she is strong, smart, yet still sexy and feminine.  I think Pauley Perette was the ideal actress to cast.  The writing seems to continue at an even keel...if nothing else getting better as more episodes are shown.  I think the producers have a hit here.  I go back each week.  Definitely worth your time...even if it means taping or tivo'ing it (which I do)...something to look forward to when I can't make 8:00 on Tuesday.",NCIS,
Human Tragedy,"This is ridiculous. After seeing the three first episodes I was watching this show for how depressingly bad it was. The show is all about who is the biggest prick and cockiest jerk. There is literally almost the same plot in every episode. And the plot is pretty bad, the acting is crap, the script is toilet paper. Nevertheless, the show gets 8.8 in rating. So, is this show better than Homeland, Walking Dead and Modern family? And almost as good as Game of thrones, Dexter and Breaking Bad? I mean WHAT THE FUC!?,This a human tragedy...,-Stayzor's out",Suits,1
Overacting and beating about the bush at its best,"Non-existing plot is the first thing that you will notice about this fake, concocted and fast paced show that is filled with over acting and unrealistic events.,This is a show that the actors made just so they can wear a suit. Awful waste of time. I gave this show the benefit of the doubt by watching the first season and was absolutely disappointed by the end of it. ,The lead character doesn't have a clue as to what he's doing. His ""enemies"" are dumber than he is but apparently they are all very cunning and bold because they are wearing suits and are dragging they feet on New York sidewalks. ,I wouldn't be surprised if the good reviews posted here for this were from the cast members and producers. ,Not recommended.",Suits,1
Yes to Izombie,"Here's an alert to some of the reviewers, who seem to view this as a traditional TV drama - It's Not. A living dead zombie who assists the police in finding bad guys after eating the brains of victims is inherently ridiculous and, consequently, tongue in cheek (or perhaps in brain). Somehow, though, the show seems to pull off a balancing act between farcical situations and scenes with real emotion and drama. ,Whether the show can develop new scenarios to maintain the interest of viewers or just repeat the same themes with minor twists remains to be seen. I have to say, though, that the pilot was very promising, largely due to the enchanting performance of Rose McIver in the lead role. She really sold the audience on the concept of a zombie as, yes, dead, but still kind of lovable. You find yourself really pulling for her.",iZombie,9
A real review for iZombie,"Veronica Mars meets something new. ,Thats really the only way to describe this. The dialog is quick witted and funny. Its got a case of the week set up which makes it perfect for casual watching and the expected twist at the end of the first episode shows there will indeed be a story going beyond the case of the week.,The lead actress is really good for this part. I liked her from the start and expect she's going to carry this show. Her supporting cast is a little bland at this point but given time I think they can grow into better characters. ,When you sit on your couch and complain about all television shows being the same and about them making yet another CSI:Alaska THIS is the show you should start watching. Ignore the Romero fan boys complaining about the Zombies. this isn't a show about Zombies! This isn't The Walking Dead. This is a light hearted take on what if a Zombie with the ability to eat brains and see visions of the persons life had to interact with the real world. Would she sit on her couch and be a Zombie or would she go out and help those that can't help themselves?",iZombie,10
Surprisingly good,"I have to confess I came to this show expecting camp Zombie chick, adolescent angst drama. ,Well, I was mostly wrong. Certainly I do believe this series may have more appeal to women than men but only by a small margin. Its certainly got some chick flick elements, issues with the boyfriend and mum, but beyond that its got a whole lot more to offer too. ,The extras, if you can call them that include top notch writing. The characterizations in iZombie are, in particular highly polished. The main characters are genuinely witty and engaging, in a very understated, down to earth way. ,This is topped off with reasonable storytelling and acting from the lead and supporting cast. ,All in all a very likable series I plan to keep on watching. A well earned seven out of ten from me.",iZombie,7
Time flies when you're enjoying yourself ," and each episode speeds along all too quickly! I LOVE this show! What is there NOT to like? Rich story lines, strongly portrayed (and very human) personalities you can really warm to who play off each other brilliantly, all with their own distinctive quirks and  above all  the always wonderful Mark Harmon as main character! What more could you ask for in a show?! There's not a single character I'd change  none that irritate  they're all excellent. I consider it a bonus that it's the one thing on TV that all our family equally enjoy for different reasons. Even my father-in-law likes this and we normally have totally different viewing preferences! I was delighted when I heard that there was a second series imminent. Only problem is that living in England, who knows how long after it's shown in the US we'll get to see it! Fortunately it's worth the wait!",NCIS,
"Easily one of the best shows on Television today, Suspenseful, Humorous and Riveting-Can't Miss TV!","Easily one of the best shows on television today, suspenseful, humorous and real-not always pleasant or formulaic-but real! Just when I think Bellesario has gone too far in the ""lets screw up Jag"" sweepstakes (ok-2 episodes this year were actually good-the rest-terrible!)-he redeems himself with a show that is riveting, timely and funny at the right times!,The casting, the writing, the overall look of the show is first class! Starting at the top with Mark Harmon, the sexiest man on TV-he also sets the tone with his right on portrayal of the most conflicted man on TV today! His obsession with Ari (the terrorist), his list of rules, then his tendency to think out of the box just adds to the spice and pace of this show. (Plus his constant dueling with DiNozzo-priceless!),An added plus is the inter meshing of the cast-David McCallum-funny, urbane- so hot! His stories are hysterical, then his sad commentary on the life or death of their latest subject-just gives you pause. His diatribe on the terrorist and what he did to his assistant alone is Emmy award stuff-don't mess with Ducky ever again! Then we have the reason for Rule 12-Special Agent Catlin Todd-the writers don't always have a clue as to her portrayal but she always pulls it off (and that humor of hers-the end lines alone are great!) I have to disagree as to the chemistry with Gibbs/Kate-it's there all right-hopefully we get to see something come of it in Season 2! The actors portraying Abby and DiNozzo-Pauly Perrette and Michael Weatherly are hysterical, yet right on in their portrayals-especially when DiNozzo thinks with his hormones and not with his brain-then turns around and saves the day-this show is a keeper! I can hardly wait for season 2!",NCIS,
Love the show,"At first when my husband would watch this show I wasn't really paying much attention and I would see this goth girl in the lab and think  ""what on earth is THAT?!?!?!"" Then, one night I sat and watched along with him and now I am totally hooked. Mark Harmon's character appears to be annoyed sometimes by the other characters actions etc. but you get the feeling he really likes his coworkers. I like David McCallum's character and the way they tease him about going on and on. I get the feeling he knows they really do like him but his stories just get to be too much for them and he understands. My favorite though is Pauley Perrette's character. She is just a lot of fun. I hope the show stays on a long time- Tuesday nights wouldn't be the same with out it.",NCIS,
Who wrote this crap?,"Suits, an obvious emergence in television set around two super-brained lawyers who get away with the stunts they pull only because the script allows it. The writing of this crap is so unbelievably juvenile and ushered in, I'm really surprised anyone can watch more than 4 episodes of this. ,Every episode is an exact copy of the previous one, with different client names and situations. Every slick rebuke that is uttered by either one of the main characters is so unbelievably set up, they might have read them off a menu.,Everything about this series feels fake and concocted. The high score this series gets from its audience either gives testament to the lousy offerings at this moment or the lack of taste of the general public.",Suits,1
Will keep watching for sure.,"Review after only watching the first episode.,I've made a rule when it comes to new TV shows. 3 episodes before giving up. I do not need that rule for this show. (unless it gets bad out of nowhere) The first episode introduced the characters well, and kept me interested while moving at a good pace. No long drawn out boring intros here. ,The show has a great balance of comedy and a decent story. I look forward to seeing where they go with this. ,The CW has been churning out some really well done shows as of late (with a few duds) so far this one is no where near a dud. ,If you like comedy, little bit of drama, and touch of science fiction give this show a try. ,I'm also kind of into Rose McIver so I may be a little bit biased.",iZombie,9

Thought it would be a loser but really kinda great,"I really liked this first episode and the way they put it all together the why and the how she ends up working with the police and how she deals with being a zombie was done nicely. It has a kinda ""6 feet under kinda feel but a little more light hearted. Also the situation is not gonna be real life so sometimes the situation is a little unbelievable, like cops aren't always gonna act the way real cops would exactly and people aren't gonna always freak at the concept of someone being a zombie etc. The humor was good too, actually caught myself in an unexpected chuckle. You know the kind that takes like a half second to hit you. very good almost gave it 9 stars but I like to save 9 and 10 for stuff I;m totally thrilled with. Acting was good the characters are likable. This could be one that moves up to the 9 or 10 start level after a few episodes",iZombie,8
"Dirty, funny, sexy, violent and unabashedly romantic: Deadpool has arrived!","I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).,The first thing I noticed was how inventive the storytelling is. The film throws you into the action from the first moment (literally: the very first moment) and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane - but oddly charming - antihero. Flashbacks and fast-forwards can be annoying as hell, but when done right, they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting. And that's exactly how Deadpool felt to me right from the start: like a fresh (if somewhat dirty) jolt of energy.,The action itself is beautifully designed, employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available; it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection. But, and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much, there's a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage, and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly Ryan Reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co-star Morena Baccarin. What came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic Deadpool is. The love story in this film is probably the most sincere I've ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lack.,The humor, which I initially feared would just be non-stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting, also works surprisingly well. Not every line or every joke lands - but that's the beauty of this character: they don't really need to. Deadpool can't help himself; as long as he's able to breathe he'll crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him. It's a clinical condition; he's not a stand-up comedian whose jokes need to land: he's a madman (albeit a very entertaining one) and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedy.,Despite all my praise, it's not a perfect film. The villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist (he insists he's not a hero) justice: but it's a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequel(s). And it's actually a very important film for another reason. If Deadpool is a financial success - which at this point is already clear it will be - this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of R-rated superhero films, and we'll hopefully see more of them in the future.,Many people might feel different - and I respect their opinion - but I've grown tired of the entirely bloodless CGI overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like Mormon schoolgirls. I mean: there's a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18, loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real-world language, real-world sex and real-world violence in superhero movies. This genre is so diverse; it's ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations - regardless of the material - must automatically be made for kids in order to be successful.,As it is, I think Deadpool - a dirty, funny, sexy and violent film which is decidedly NOT for kids - just proved my point perfectly. 8 stars out of 10.,Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/,Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/,Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/,Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",Deadpool,8
Awesome,"When the show first started out it was a little shaky, but since then has grown into its own. The characters are believable, both annoying and enchanting, and the plots are wonderful. There's a depth and a comradeship that isn't often showed this well in television. It isn't forced or faked; it's entirely true to life and believable. ,The underlying sexual tension between several of the characters is also intriguing and interesting to watch, the most obvious of these being the relationship between Tony and Kate, but there's also hints at Kate and Gibbs, McGee and Abby, and so on. It's a crime drama that's both serious and light-hearted, and a wonderful show for anyone who likes fascinating stories, good humor, and great character interaction.",NCIS,
So much better than its parent show,"Finally Bellisario got it right.  Gibbs and his gang are first and foremost investigators, not hoity-toity staff officers who moonlight as stereotyped combat soldiers with thickly-laid-on patriotic dogma that would make Ward Carroll vomit with rage.  At no time do they ever try to borrow an F-14 to go on some bombing raid over the international hot spot du semaine; they stick to their job descriptions the whole time.  They also have personalities and eccentricities that make them a better ridealong than overstarched Harmless Rabbit and whatever babe he happens to be working with this season, such as Gibbs' coffee addiction, Ducky's intellectual ramblings, DiNozzo's attempts at being a cool womanizer, Abby's interesting blend of science nerd and goth grrrl, and Kate as the token vaguely normal neophyte thrown into the mix.  Too bad this couldn't have been done with JAG in the first place.",NCIS,
My new guilty pleasure.,"As a zombie and horror fan I had to make myself watch. Knowing that it was clearly not a traditional zombie experience had me a bit turned off at first. However, I saw the pilot episode and I loved it. It is a bit campy but very fun and it has a crime drama spin so I think there will always be an interesting story to tell.The main characters are already very charming and have the potential to develop and evolve as the show matures. I adore the adorable yet potentially dangerous zombie and her over the top geeky medical examiner boss as well as the detective who is obviously going to be dependent on her mysterious psychic abilities. I really hope it makes the cut for CW.",iZombie,10
"Novel Idea, But Writing Quickly Becomes Cliché","I started watching iZombie about a week ago, binge-watching on Netflix. The first episode was great: Introduction of characters, humorous mannerisms and situations, but also the introduction of a more serious central plot.,The show handles both funny and serious situations well, the dialogue is good and the actors are fantastic in their roles.,However, the writers are sloppy/lazy in resorting to clichés to keep the show moving from week to week: First, you have the device where the main character has a secret that she cannot share with anyone, thus leading to all the opportunities one could ask for to create funny or ""dramatic"" situations. Sure, at first one could understand that Liv could be terrified of her condition, and afraid of what might happen should her family, loved ones or public find out about her condition. But that only holds up for a few episodes. It becomes clear after one gets to know Major that you realize she could have explained to him that she'd contracted a condition that was contagious, and that prevented her from having the contact or experiences a full life demanded. Instead, she keeps her secrets and as the series progresses and Major begins to find out that strange things are going on, she continues to hide the truth, even though he's getting into a dangerous situation. And that's only one example.,Another problem is Liv's tendency to take on the personality of people who's brain she eats. This is only true insofar as it serves the plot. For example, as a radio talk show host she becomes an insufferable bitch psychoanalyzing every man she knows, almost to the point of ruining a friendship. However, when she has the opportunity to eliminate a zombie murderer/drug dealer while ""possessed"" by the personality of a sniper, she decides at the crucial moment that she isn't a killer. Sure, she has no alternate plan for stopping the thug from continuing to murder people and sell their brains for profit, but she passes on the chance to end this blight on the human (and zombie) race. As a result, her boyfriend, also a zombie, is murdered.,Basically, the writers use a lack of communication between Liv and others, even when it would make sense, to create tension or humor in the show, and her ability to absorb personalities and see their memories is a deus ex machina that allows crime cases to be easily solved, often leading to humorous scenes as well.,Most people will enjoy watching iZombie, but if you were weaned on ""smart"" shows with Emmy Award-winning writing, I doubt you'll stay with it for long. And you shouldn't: there are plenty of brilliant, quality shows to see, and there's no need to waste your time on the bottom 50%.",iZombie,5
"Give this show a chance, I did, and I loved it!!","I want to start off this review by letting you guys know that you can watch episode 6-10 of iZombie FOR FREE on the CW website (Yes, you do have to turn ad-block off).,This show was such a pleasant surprise to discover; the only reason I was able to find this show was through watching The Flash and Arrow. In between commercials for these two shows, they occasionally show commercials for iZombie, but I've always ignored them. Eventually over time I start noticing them more and more and I was getting really intrigued. After my friend, who's also big comic book/manga nerd like I am, recommended me to watch iZombie, I decided to finally give it a chance.,I was hooked on the first show. The atmosphere is dark and playful at the same time, the dialog is quick and witty, and the plot is crazy! Girl scratched by a zombie becomes a zombie herself and can only feed her hunger with brains. She gains the memories and experiences of the eaten brain for a certain amount of time and uses this skill to help her detective friend solve their deaths. OMG who thinks of this stuff?!?!,It's not just the stereotypical crime at the beginning of the show, everything comes together at the end, almost everyone looks like a model kind of show. I mean it is, but they do it soooo much better than most shows I've seen. The show continues along at a great pace, the characters are so well developed and intriguing that I wish I knew them in real life, and they keep surprising me with each show. The brain eating aspect really brings some incredibly situations and first person views of the victims and I think that it really adds to the originality of the show.",iZombie,9
This is what it looks like when filmmakers take risks,"Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.,Deadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of February (surpassing Fifty Shades of Grey), the biggest opening weekend for 20th Century Fox (surpassing all the X-Men films), and the biggest opening weekend for an R rated film EVER (surpassing The Matrix: Reloaded). With all that being said, Deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of Reynolds himself. His comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character, who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed. Of course, credit should be given to the writers too (AKA: The Real Heroes Here), and it's impressive that this is Tim Miller's directorial debut. The action sequences and pacing are so good that you'd think this came from a veteran director.,From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends clichés and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.",Deadpool,8
a much needed breath of fresh air in a stale genre,"At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. ,The first thing that is unique about this film is the characters. In typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious, in Deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious Francis to the silly Deadpool giving this a parody like feel, in a good way.,Also what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city/world/universe that is seen in every single superhero film. Also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly, this film just does not stop the laughs (I laughed 20- 30 times in my SECOND watch). ,As for being an origin story, I can say that the backstory placements were well done, equally as funny, and explains only what is important in understanding the story. Final rating 10/10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever made",Deadpool,9
I can't understand who wouldn't find this show fantastic,"I respect that different people have different tastes in music, clothes, women, movies etc...but if you are saying that this show is bad I really feel like your sense of humor is lacking. I'm a detective for one of the largest police departments in the country and I will advise everyone that doesn't realize it but this show is closer to how real police go about their day than any of those CSI, or garbage procedural shows. Cops do all that stuff all day...pranking each other, busting balls, trying to have a little fun. The job gets a little heavy sometimes so if we didn't have some fun it would be long days. This show is hilarious and perfectly timed retorts by Braugher and Crews are classic. Its the low key lines that make I hilarious...the over the top cheap laughs are somethkng all shows have to do to please the masses...who are stupid. Pay attention to the underlying comedy...its priceless.......""Terry does love yogurt""",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,9
Navy's Finest Are Top-Notch,"*SPOILERS NCIS* The NCIS (Navy Criminal Investigative Service) is a service that investigates on any kind of crime, from barroom brawls to international terrorism, that involves men and women from the Navy or Marine Corps.,The team is formed by: Leroy Jethro Gibbs (the second B stays for Bastard) (Mark Harmon), the moody, intuitive head investigator; he likes his coffee very strong, his women with red hair, and his investigations thorough. It is rare to get a compliment for him; when you get one, don't ask why. He is very loyal, and actually cares for his team, but has problems with women (evidence of this being three failed weddings). ,Anthony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Gibbs' 2IC; a smartmouth, player to the soul and proud of it, who masks his quick mind and powerful intuition with a happy-go-lucky (and sometimes obnoxious) attitude. Sometimes he can behave in quite the juvenile way, and when he is, a good headslap by Gibbs will help him put things straight (this two have also what could possibly be the strongest homosexual subtext - more of an almost-text - in TV History). He enjoys to torment someone, usually the newest element of the team. Dearly departed Special Agent Kate Todd (more later) and Special Agent Tim McGee (more later) have suffered the brunt of that in various occasions. Comes from money, but doesn't get an allowance because if he did, he wouldn't work, and it seems there is bad blood between him and his family. He has a deep love of movies and TV Shows (one of his favorites is 'Ozzy And Harriet'), and referred to movie-acquired knowledge various times.,Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), killed in the Season 2 Finale, who came from Secret Service, and made a point of bringing it up whenever the occasion presented itself, and came off as quite the uptight girl; all in all, the weakest character in the show, though her witty 'Hepburn-Tracy' rapid-fire dialogues with DiNozzo were great, and she had with him the strongest hetero almost-text this side of Gil Grissom and Catherine Willows.,Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) a perky Goth (not as oxymorous as it sounds) who has an imprecise number of tattoos on her body and is the greatest at her job. She loves to hear techno or hard rock music (like Android Lust) played at a very loud volume while working. She is the only person in the team Gibbs actually shows affection for, and she is currently dating Special Agent Tim McGee (more later).,Tim McGee (Sean Murray), who joined the team in the second season after making various guest-appearances throughout the first season. Tim is a computer whiz, but is at a loss when it comes to social life; has gotten a tattoo on his butt to impress Sciuto - and it worked. Has been mercilessly teased by DiNozzo when he first joined the team, getting the absolutely-not-flattering nickname 'Probie' ('Pivello' ('Greenhorn') in the Italian Version). He has proved his valor, though, time and time again.,And last but not least, Donald 'Ducky' Mallard (David McCallum), the ME, who has two curious habits; one, to talk to the corpses he is going to autopsy, and the other, to go off on tales that are very loosely related to the case in question. He likes the music Abby plays, but not distorted by speakers, lives with his mother, who, wearing only Chanel N°5 when she goes to bed, hosts very awkward slumber parties and has various dogs, he is the one who has worked the longest with Gibbs and looked like 'Ilya Kuryakin' when he was younger.,This is the team (I'm not talking about Ziva and Madame Director because I have yet to see Season 3), and my suggestion is to watch them in action, every Tuesday, 8/7 central, on CBS.,You won't be disappointed.,NCIS: 9/10.",NCIS,9
Still going strong,"I've written about this show before on IMDb --- but here I am months later in May 2005 and yet it still continues to be impressive. There have been a few shows that were ""bleh"" in the last season but the ""SWAK"" episode tonight really got a few great moments of emotion between the cast members. The writers (at least to me) were able to pull off the ""suspended disbelief"" and I got pulled into the moment as DiNozzo was about to kick the bucket. I sure hope they keep most of the cast in the next season, as they seem to play off each other brilliantly. The only cast member I could see losing (according to the season finale preview, they lose an NCIS agent) is McGee. He's great and believable for his role, but any of the others lost as regulars on the show would break down the core character interplay. The McGee character could be replaced...but the others would be much more difficult. But then again I guess this is all decided and in the can...we'll find out on May 24th. My comments to other viewers that have commented on the reality of the series --- yeah, it's not the real life NCIS at all. But real life would be mind-numbingly boring to fit in 60 minute TV show. You'd need the constant buzz of fluorescent lights in the background combined with pages and pages of forms being typed into the computer --- mostly about drug abuses by young 18 year olds. This is TV drama and a fabricated fiction. I appreciate the nod Bellesario gives to NCIS and like the show for the entertainment it is. Real life NCIS isn't a fun job, but we get an hour on Tuesday night to pretend it is.",NCIS,
"Quirky plot, charming actors.","Let me preface this review by stating that I am not a fan of zombie-themed entertainment. While I am a horror-lover, I do not find zombies - or vampires, for that matter - to be particularly frightening. Plus, they've been done to death (haha). Particularly recently.,That said, when I saw the pilot featured on Hulu I didn't have high hopes. Still, I had some time to kill, so I gave it a try, and I'm really glad that I did. As of today (3/30/15) there are only two episodes out, but I thoroughly enjoyed both of them. I found the show to be quirky and the actors likable. The show follows a fairly standard ""solve a murder an episode"" format, couched in an overarching ""figure out Zombism"" / ""are there others? and, if so, how many?"" plot. ,For some reason, the vibe I get from iZombie is similar to 'Pushing Daisies,' which I count as a major plus. The first two episodes definitely left me wanting more, though it's more for the charm and entertainment value than any real curiosity of the major storyline's advancement.,I am definitely suggesting that my friends watch this show, and I have high hopes that it will continue to be enjoyable. I do have some reservations that it may start to focus too heavily on convoluted romantic hijinks, but I am hoping that I will be pleasantly surprised.",iZombie,8
It just wasn't outstanding...,"I was thrilled about the release of this series back in 2015, but didn't have a chance to get to watch it before 2016. And I had been warmly recommended to watch it, given its zombiesque nature and the entire nature of the storyline, so I was anxious to sit down and watch it.,Then I got the chance, and I managed to get halfway through season one before I just simply gave up. My expectations were brutally murdered by how bland and generic ""iZombie"" turned out to be. It was essentially just another crime solving show, but with a zombie twist. And I don't like watching these crime shows where the protagonists solve every single crime in every single episode. And ""iZombie"" was just that. There are far too many crime solving series available, and one with a zombie twist didn't really make it outstanding.,Sure it had the twist that Olivia (played by Rose McIver) was a zombie and was able to take on characteristics and traits from those individuals brains she would consume. And that would help to solve the crimes. Nah, it just didn't work for me.,And as for zombies being in the show, well don't get your hopes up, because it is nothing more than just pale make-up slapped on the performing actors. So in terms of zombie make-up and gore, don't expect any.,Rose McIver and Rahul Kohli does carry the series nicely enough, but their characters and the fact that this was just another crime show (with a zombie twist) just didn't cut it for me.,I was sorely disappointed with what ""iZombie"" turned out to be, and after having watched half of the episodes of season one, I am not going to return to the series. It will now just stand on the shelves and collect dust.,This was a very mediocre experience for me. And as such ""iZombie"" scores only five out of ten stars from me. And the fact that I don't like watch crime solving shows didn't really work in favor of ""iZombie"" either.",iZombie,5
Best Movie I Have Seen In A Long Time,"Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had ""Foul Language"" and ""Sex Scenes"" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.",Deadpool,10
Simply Excellent.,"Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way.,Wade Wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in New York City protecting teenage girls from would-be stalkers. He meets escort Vanessa Carlysle at a local bar and they become romantically attached for nearly a year. He proposes to her one night, then he suddenly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Though she remains by his side, he fears losing her.,One night at the bar that he met Vanessa, he is approached by a recruiter from a secret program. He is offered an experimental cure for his cancer, but he rebuffs the man and leaves. Desperate to live, he reconsiders and leaves Vanessa in the middle of the night to undergo the procedure. He is injected with a special serum by Francis Freeman and tortured for days by Angel Dust in order to trigger a mutation. After weeks of no success, Wade is strapped into an airtight chamber after insulting Francis. The drop in oxygen triggers a healing factor that removes his cancer, but severely disfigures his face and skin in the process. He escapes from the chamber by blowing it up and attempts to kill Francis, only stopping when he claims he can cure Wade's disfigurement. He is then impaled by rebar and left for dead in the destruction of the lab.,Although he tracks her down, he cannot come to terms with his complexion, and he keeps himself away from Vanessa. Wade moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al, and with the advice of his best friend Weasel, he becomes a masked vigilante named ""Deadpool"", and begins hunting down Francis and dismantling his organization.,Following a string of leads from various syndicates, Deadpool attacks a convoy of cars on an expressway before getting his hands on Francis, demanding for a cure to his disfigurement. The confrontation is suddenly interrupted by the X-Men Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who want him to join the team. Their intervention enables Francis to run off, and when Colossus handcuffs himself to Deadpool on their way back to the X-Mansion, Deadpool cuts off his own hand and escapes back to his home.,The next night, Weasel convinces Deadpool to go back to Vanessa, but when they arrive at the strip club she works at, Deadpool discovers that she has been kidnapped, and Francis and Angel Dust tell him to meet up with them on a decommissioned aircraft carrier at a scrapyard.,Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him, and the trio take a cab to the scrapyard, where Colossus and Negasonic have a grueling battle with Angel Dust while Deadpool slashes through an army of goons on his way toward Francis. Deadpool and Francis then engage in a bloody hand-to-hand combat before Negasonic uses her power to destroy the aircraft carrier. In the end, Deadpool gains the upper hand in the fight and Francis admits that there is no cure for Wade's disfigurement. Although Colossus urges Deadpool to spare Francis and be a true hero, he shoots Francis in the head, finally killing him and avenging himself. Deadpool removes his mask and shows Vanessa his new face. Though she is angry that he left her, she accepts him and they reconcile by kissing.,In a post-credits scene, Deadpool urges the audience to leave and go home, then announces that there will be a sequel involving Cable.",Deadpool,10
"""Bad Deadpool - Good Deadpool Film!""","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.,Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.,One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.,As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.,Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!,""Deadpool"" and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!",Deadpool,9
One of the most promising comedy shows to air this season,"Brooklyn Nine Nine is a new age police procedural comedy with an excellent cast and spectacular production. But that isn't what makes the show great, rather its something very trivial. The show, being a comedy, peculiarly enough,doesn't use any laugh track or a live audience to record laughs. In fact, they just provide us with a sketch where the viewer can decide whether it was funny enough for him to enjoy (laugh) or not.The show should be credited for its humorous subplots within an episode.The cast also portray their characters in an outstandingly witty fashion. The writer's vision of a comic police station is right on the money. I may have been biased so i couldn't think of flaws. An Amazing show. One of 2013's best.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
"A surprisingly pleasant, silly yet witty show.","After first hearing about Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I was fairly skeptical about yet another attempt on Fox's part to regain their former position as king of network comedy, however; minutes after it had started, I was able to find an affection for this show that I haven't had for a comedy pilot since The Office.,Anchored in large part by Andy Samberg's ironic sense of humor, it also features plenty of dead-pan humor and caricatures, much of it being a parody of the typical crime drama.,Half-way through, I realized it felt fairly reminiscent of The Office's early days, unbeknownst to me that was intended to channel that style and humor, despite it not being a mockumentary.,Personally, I felt it to be one of the strongest pilots for a comedy I had seen in a while. They introduce the audience to the characters in a way that doesn't come across as them trying to bluntly introduce us, as so many shows clumsy do; Shows that tell us how close two friends are in a way real people don't talk, by having one of them tell the other, ""I know you said you didn't want to hang out Friday but I'm your best friend and we're going to hang out."" Brooklyn 9-9 accomplishes these crucial initial first impressions by not overstating the core personalities of the characters. Half way in, we quickly begin to experience the precincts average day and learn of the quirky interactions that occur between characters alongside the new C.O., Capt. Holt(Andre Braugher). Some characters do leave something to be desired in terms of having something to offer to the show, but the groundwork is solid.,There certainly is the expected detective work, but the main focus is the ludicrous and off-beat styles of the detectives. One of the best things I like about this show, thus far, is the fact that it is able to surprise me with its jokes, most of which are not exactly the shock-value type that are only there because they're so random they're humorous. Though as I recall, that style is mixed in with other, more witty jokes.,I don't see this as a show that will appeal to mass audiences, simply because it is more quirky and witty, though not necessarily requiring its viewers to think more about the jokes.,People who enjoy(ed) shows like The Office, Parks and Rec., Community, South Park, Psych, possibly Modern Family, etc., will more likely than not find something to like about this show.,Obviously not everyone will appreciate it, but I strongly encourage those who are interested in watching it, to watch the entire pilot before making a full opinion.,In the end, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fun and silly satire about the clichés of police shows, while still able to not take itself too seriously.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,7
"Good show, but too much propaganda","The first couple of seasons are great, with the chocking ending of season two finale ""Twilight"" as a specific high-point. Then the show stumbles a bit for a season or two, before it creates perhaps the best episodes and best entertainment you can find anywhere. But then it starts to slowly go downwards, and lately it is hardly watchable. ,There are two main faults with this show. Firstly it has gone on for too long. It is very apparent when you read the synopsis of each episode and you notice that 80% has basically been copy pasted. I mean, how many petty officer's and lieutenants can be murdered? Adding together the corpses from this show and there would hardly be anyone left to invade the next country U.S. want to destroy. Secondly the show is almost 100% propaganda, especially lately. The longer the show goes on, the more saluting the flag, all marines are heroes and U.S is always the good guy crap we see. There are plenty of episodes where I root for the ""villains"" because clearly they are in the right. ,The best part of the show are the characters. Great, amazing characters. Without them and great acting this show would have died a long time ago. ,At the end though, as a summation of all seasons, this is not a very good show. The last 3-4 season has been to fill up and make money. There are very few good stories left, and even the acting has gone down. Perhaps it is a 5 in total, but I subtract two additional points for the blatant and in-your-face propaganda which is just ridiculous. If you watch this and feel like a proud American or you want to join the military to go overseas to slaughter the innocent, then this show is for you, thinking people and adults should however stay away.",NCIS,3
"Nincompoops, Chowderheads, Idiots, and Simpletons","A friend of mine describes the cast of characters in this show as ""a delightfully dysfunctional family."" I certainly will agree that they are dysfunctional. Delightful? Not so much.,This is a crime show in a period where crime shows are all the rage, so the formula is a familiar one: a crime - usually, but not always, murder - is discovered at the beginning of the show, and the cast are the people who solve the crime. The main difference is that these crimes take place in the military, so the crime solvers aren't detectives, but agents. Leading our intrepid pack is Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), ""the best agent ever,"" according to director, Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly). The rest of the team consists of Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Wetherley), whose last name fittingly rhymes with ""Bozo,"" Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), who seems to perpetually be the unrespected ""probie,"" and Agent Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), who died at the end of season 2, and was replaced by Israeli Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who, despite having been in the USA for many years, still doesn't seem to get American cultural references. They are assisted by Dr. Donald Mallard (David McCollum), incongruously called ""Ducky,"" and Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), arguably the brains of the outfit, although her area of expertise is never specified. Somehow this rather offbeat and bumbling combination manages to solve the crime every week, and successfully sees that the guilty party faces the proper authorities.,The writing of this show is an odd mixture in that they do manage to come up with some intriguing scenarios, but have created some of the most unlikable characters I've ever encountered. Gibbs seems to rely on little else besides an arrogant stare and hitting his team members upside the back of the head to solve crimes. DiNozzo takes cluelessness to levels that really ought to get him thrown out of the Navy. Ziva covers her inability to get American culture with an attitude of superiority that is wearing. Ducky is a little too eager to describe the results of his autopsies in gory detail - with visual aids. And Abby really leaves me wondering how she manages to exist outside the confines of an institution. The only one I find to be both smart and likable is McGee, and nobody listens to him. Their efforts to solve crimes often come across as bumbling as the Keystone cops, and I'm left wondering how this is supposed to be representative of the Navy's finest.,Given that the characterizations are so unpleasant, it's hard to know how much of that is the fault of the writing, and how much of the actors themselves. Since the characterizations are so consistent from week to week (perhaps a little too consistent, since in some cases they show no growth at all), I'm inclined to say that the actors are doing a good job with limited material. Frankly, they could all benefit from a chance to stretch a bit with their characters, and I think they're all easily up to the challenge.,While I think the idea of showing us how the Navy deals with crimes that take place among its members is a good premise, I really don't care for the artistic choices made in bringing this show to life. In short, these aren't people that I want to invest an hour of my time watching, and the only way I'd ever enjoy the show is if somebody hit Gibbs upside the back of the head - repeatedly. Still, clearly, I'm in the minority, and it looks like this ""delightfully dysfunctional family"" will be around for awhile solving crimes and entertaining the masses. Enjoy, everybody!",NCIS,1
Ok but gets repetitive,"This is a reasonably good show but I found myself getting a little bored with the 'eat someone's brain to get their memories' in each episode.......and then helping the police to solve cases.... sorry but that's been done a million times. ,I don't known how this show gets a IMDB rating of 8,I have given it a 6 because the first few episodes were fun",iZombie,6
"Funny, entertaining and refreshing","I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.,The story of Deadpool isn't complex or profound - and it wasn't meant to be. This movie is all about fun and entertainment, abundant with action, jokes, blood and foul language. Therefore, it is not suitable for children. I grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children only.,Related to that, I believe that many Marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didn't refrain from gory scenes. I am sorry, but if you want to make a serious combat-based movie and you make it without blood, than that movie will be all but serious.,That is why I see Deadpool as a refreshment. Nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies. That really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realization.,Thus, to me, Deadpool was a very pleasant surprise, I had fun watching it, and I intend to watch it again some time soon.",Deadpool,8
Defend the 10 again,"I've said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect. There aren't any movies that actually deserve a perfect score. But what if you were a dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too, and had already played the character once with horrible results wished for redemption? What if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise above the whole PG-13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into these days? What character would be completely drowned in such a pool? Wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton, though he did finally get unleashed with an R rated send off film (possibly partly thanks to this movie). But Deadpool could never have been done right in a PG-13 movie. The Merc with the Mouth had to have his lips sowed shut the first go round and after that... well... most fans would say he was never truly Deadpool. Including the man who played him.,Ryan Reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of playing a real Deadpool. And boy does he. The R rating took the comic book genre to a sparkly place I wish it would have gone to years ago. Oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and Reynolds nails it. Possibly thanks to the fact that he actually cared.,But how good is it as a movie aside from all that? Well, I gave it a ten. It might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasn't so special. It was the first R rated movie of its kind and it proved to the people, and the studios, that it could be extremely successful even with that rating. Thank you Deadpool. You deserve an extra star for that alone.",Deadpool,10
Boring and Pointless,"One word describes this movie - pointless.,Wow, this film was incredibly boring. People are hyping this movie over nothing. The story is so simple and boring. It didn't even feel like I was watching a thought-provoking movie, more like a short and simple TV series with an unfunny, forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains. ,The X-men were pointless as well. They didn't add anything to the story. They only assisted Deadpool with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have deadpool work for them. They happily accepted Deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them. ,The only okay point in this movie was the action. However, the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times, and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography. It didn't feel intense at all, more like you know the villains are going to fail very easily.,I also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program e.g. ""superheroes"", ""superslaves"" etc. What are these villains even doing? There was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains. The story was lacking in too many ways. The world felt very empty and hollow.,Looks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is r-rated. That is the truth, that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of ""F"" words and other vulgar words, it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent. None of this is new. Again, the Story and Characters are terrible.",Deadpool,1
Please don't cancel Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"This show is a masterpiece. I honestly don't know why and how it's underrated. Sure, I love a good sitcom like Friends, and although some might not agree, I actually find B99 more hilarious compared to those kind of shows.,Let's see:,I'm gonna be really sad if B99 wont be renewed for a 6th season, because it deserves so much more than that.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
"Very Funny, Great Cast, Great Characters","It may be too soon to say having not even finished their first season yet, but since i haven't seen an episode i didn't enjoy i think its safe to say this one is a keeper. The one issue i have is how short the episodes are, which means if you watch the trailer for the series you've already seen half of the first episode. There's a lot of great jokes particularly regarding the characters, each one with their own eccentric personalities, and one of the things i love about this show is that it doesn't have to play on racial stereotypes to be funny. Its got one of the most ethnically diverse casts out there but it doesn't even care because thats not who they are. for instance Terry Crews doesn't play the hardened streetwise character, he plays the hulkish desk sergeant who is absolutely terrified of guns. Seeing Terry Crews scream like a little girl and freak out trying to put a magical princess castle together is just priceless gold. Or Rosa, the extremely abrasive criminally adept cop who doesn't have an off switch for her intimidating nature. The conversations between her and the timid pushover Detective Boyle make for some great television.,""go to your happy place"" ""what is that? that sounds stupid."",There's also the expressionless, unreadable openly gay police captain who is anything but a gay stereotype, the sociopathically manipulative secretary who in her own words ""thrives on dysfunctional relationships"", and detective scully who is in every sense of the word a failure, smelly, lazy, unadept and just all around a horrible police officer. Andy Sandberg really is just the cherry on top of a great ensemble cast. He plays his normal goofy immature character, but he's not without his redeeming qualities. He embarrasses himself on more than one occasion but this causes people to underestimate him and his wit which he uses to actually solve crimes. This and his competitiveness with detective Santiago cause him to keep his successes just above his screw-ups, and if he didn't actually solve cases he'd probably be fired for goofing off on the job. ,Overall i want to see Peralta learn some restraint and become a bit more devious, the competitive sexual tension between Peralta and Santiago become an even more competitive relationship and for Boyle to have a life changing experience when he finally sleeps with Rosa... Or just embarrass himself with a past due, overbearing attempt to become a man.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
Great New Series on TV this season+,This is a great series to watch.  I have been hooked on this show since the beginning because I love watching mysteries and crime like CSI and CSI Miami.  Harmon's so sexy in this role and McCallum is always a joy to watch as Ducky especially when he's on the role over various anthropology lectures which to my amusement everyone on that shows roll up their eyeballs.,NCIS,10
"Good Actors, Poor Stories","Recently sat through a virtual marathon of episodes from various seasons and came away disappointed and disbelieving. This show seems to have devolved to the low levels first achieved with ""24"" showing government agents doing bad things for good reasons. Suspects/witnesses are routinely subjected to insults, lies and in many instances physical abuse to achieve ends. Superiors, agents of similar agencies and other services as well as local law enforcement are routinely treated with ill-disguised contempt if not outright disdain.,It is doubtful that any of the cases ""solved"" by this group would get by a grand jury let alone result in conviction in a full blown trial, given their intimidation tactics and routine lack of warrants for searches. In one episode, David, the Israeli Mossad agent, is left alone to physically torture a female office employee with the knowing consent of her boss, Gibbs. In another, she kicks a handcuffed male suspect in the groin. In other episodes, Gibbs and his fellow agents lie to and threaten American citizens and legally resident aliens with indefinite detention in Guantanamo.,Some may find this kind of show wishfully entertaining. One can only hope that it is not taken by foreign audiences as realistically representative of the U.S. legal system.",NCIS,1
Good Fun,"I've been watching NCIS since it started and have been a regular viewer since the debut. The first reason I tuned in was simple - Mark Harmon. Second reason was, well, Michael Weatherly. David McCallum was just a really nice bonus. That being said ... I know that NCIS as it is shown on the screen is ludicrous, so is CSI and all its off shoots, but if you show what really happens in any investigation you'll chase off the audience with boredom.,Mark Harmon has brought a sense of realism to the Leroy Jethro Gibbs character to the point that my former active duty Marine husband swears up and down that Harmon MUST have been a Gunny in real life. Either this one or a previous one, he's just too good playing a senior NCO Reservist Marine and a cop. Gibbs is also a top-notch ""Training Officer"" who clearly trains all of his people to be able to step up and take control and command of a team in a moment's notice.,Michael Weatherly has matured as an actor - I first noticed him in Dark Angel - and he has wisely chosen to let his character on the show, Anthony ""Tony"" DiNozzo, to mature at a natural rate. Slowly. He's gone from an annoying frat-like not-quite-mature man to a deep thinker and a MUCH better investigator who can handle deep cover assignments if needed. Maybe not as well Gibbs could handle it, but that sort of skill takes time and multiple assignments to be fully qualified (and by then, the Feds tend to ship you off to their Academies so you can teach what you've learned).,Cote de Pablo (Mossad Officer Ziva David) replaced Sasha Alexander (Caitlin ""Kate"" Todd) and I'm probably in the minority when I say ""THANK YOU"" to the casting department for that. I found Todd to be a rather flat, and annoying, character. Oh she had a few lines here and there that were light hearted and worth a giggle - usually at DiNozzo's expense - but for the most part she was played a little too 'boy next door, or trying to be' by Alexander. Cote, at least, has played Ziva as a very capable, and very female, Intelligence Officer. I think this is why most folks don't like Ziva, they expect a Law Enforcement officer type character but she's an Intelligence Agent. Think CIA and kick it up several notches - you don't mess with Mossad unless you have a death wish. Cote clearly realizes this and plays ""Officer David"" with that in mind.,David McCallum, Doctor Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard, is always a joy to see on the screen and I love the 'quirks' David has given Ducky. I suspect there is a history behind Ducky's 'adventure stories' that could easily fill several books - and be considered too implausible to be anything but fiction. Ducky brings a human element to the position of Medical Examiner, a warmth that civilians don't think M.E.'s have but usually do. The ones I know also have wicked, if dry, senses of humor and McCallum has joyfully taken the humor route with Ducky and I, for one, appreciate it.,Another quirky character is, of course, Pauley Perrett's Abby Scuitto, Goth Forensic Scientist. Her portrayal of Abby is spot on as Pauley is the only person I've heard of playing a Criminal Scientist who actually has the sheepskin in the discipline. Nothing like a touch of realism to bring a character to life! Of course, people complain that Scuitto shouldn't be permitted to work in a federal job with the obvious life style she has - to you I say, HorseFeathers. If Abby were less capable at her job, she wouldn't be there as long as she has been. Nor would any of her supervisors put up with her oddities.,Now to speak of the other ""Geek"" on the team - Timothy McGee. Techno-geek. Keyboard Wizard. Sean Murray needs to do only one thing to make me totally happy with his character and his protrayl of McGee-cut his hair! I realize that the McGee character has a life outside of NCIS - as a published novelist no less - and probably keep his hair on the long side to emphasize his Authorial Air but... I hate the way it's flopped in his face this past season.,The writing on this show, like others, is usually tight but like other shows there are episodes where the writing was clearly 'off' when the idea was dreamt up or the script approved. The fact that the cast can take a lousy script and still get a watchable show out of it, is nothing short of amazing. Is NCIS accurate? No. Is NCIS a good way to learn about the Marine Corps or the Navy? Uh, no. Better talk to a recruiter if you're thinking of joining the military. Is NCIS good fun? YEAP!",NCIS,8
"It starts out awesome, but becomes stale","I loved most of the first season. It's unique and full of dark comedy. I even started waking up earlier so that I'd have more time to binge watch it. However, I got bored and annoyed by almost everything by the beginning of the second season, so I stopped watching.",iZombie,6
underwhelming,"I admit I had high expectations having seen Veronica Mars, which may have ultimately ruined my experience with iZombie.,I was surprised by how average and mundane it comes off, considering the supernatural element; ultimately it's just another crime of the week TV-show. The fact that she's a zombie doesn't seem to pose any problems in her life, nor add anything unique to the story. Most of the time she just eats brains of dead people to get clues to the murder, and so in the end it's a lot like watching the mentalist. ,As opposed to Veronica Mars, the mysteries are boring, the characters are realistic but not particularly interesting, and their is no overarching story line to keep the interest. Even Bones was more interesting than this.,I've only watched five episodes though so hopefully it will pick up. For now, I found it kind of meh.",iZombie,7
Worst Marvel movie ever made,"If you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you. Every other line contains the F word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest around.,The story is about as hollow as the humor. It's a cheap and bland story about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of ""love"" that is as misguided as the character's personality.The movie is littered with sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a while.,Ryan Reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie, cursing and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is very funny. ,This is the most overrated movie I've seen. Most of these reviews on IMDb had to have been paid for. Hollywood had to have paid for this hype or people these days have really low standards. This is a low brow film like no other.,Save 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie.",Deadpool,1
"Well, blow me!","Let me say at the very beginning of this review, I loathe super hero movies. I can not stress that point enough. For me, watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is, for me, akin to having teeth pulled. Painful to say the least. My friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise, and through sufferance, I've endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more Lycra-clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat (there are of course exceptions to the above; 'The Dark Knight', the original 'X-Men),I was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching Deadpool would be an excellent waste of my time. I envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest, followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping. Well that new Morphy Richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold, shock of all shocks, this film is bloody marvellous!! Bloody, hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off, marvellous!,The dialogue is witty, sincere, and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius, than drab scripted nonsense.,The pacing of the movie is excellent. It held my interest through its entirety.,The actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned director.,I was so pleased that for once, I was being forced to watch a movie that treated me like an adult, with adult humour and themes, made for adults. Not for grown children masquerading as adults.,This film is a perfect storm! Just everything is right! I look forward, to my great surprise to any squeals!",Deadpool,8
Hilarious,"So I watch a lot of American cop shows like Criminal Minds and Castle, but as much as I love them, sometimes I feel like they're hugely unrealistic and over-dramatised. Brooklyn Nine-nine is a play on those kind of cop shows and it does it spectacularly. Also it even has a more realistic feel than the other cop shows. ,The writing is genius and the acting is spot on. I haven't seen a show this good in a while. It's funny, clever and endearing. I saw it on the Golden Globes and I'd seen a trailer for it and I was incredibly skeptical when I watched it thinking it'd be one of the awful American spoofs they do. But I was highly surprised making me love it even more!",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,9
Am I the only one who hates this show?,"As a prior Marine, I know what NCIS actually does, and chasing terrorists through the streets of Washington DC is not it. If they were trying to make this a serious show, they failed horribly. I gave the show a chance because I was intrigued by the two part JAG episode in which it was introduced, but on it's own it fails to hold water. It basically became ""how can we make JAG more like CSI?"" Half the time they are investigating crimes that would be under FBI jurisdiction (notibly terrorism). The absolute worst part is the characters which are so stereotypical and one-dimensional:,You got your hard ass burnout-cop leader (Gibbs). Your chauvinistic frat boy (DiNozzo). Your sexy but-I'm-still-tough token female agent (Todd, now Ziva). Your lost-in-the-sauce FNG (McGee). Your techie nerd (Abby).,On the plus side, I have to admit I like Ducky. He's pretty cool. If only they could write his character off the show and move him to CSI.,Those like me who are familiar with the military will probably not like this show. Everyone else will (apparently) love it.",NCIS,2
Review after 12 seasons : show started OK to become the most unbelievably bad series ever,"I'm reviewing NCIS after watching 12 seasons.,I don't know how I made it past 5 seasons actually. But sometimes there's nothing to watch. The show actually started out OK. But after Sasha Alexander was killed off it just became an avalanche of badly repeated recipes, mixed with some extremely cliché characters.,The NCIS is not an anti-terrorist task force. Yet this is how the show portrays them. All the characters are the worst stereotype you can think of. Maybe not Ducky. He's the only one that is likable.,What frustrates me most is how CHEAP the show is. 90% of the victims are found in the same setting : either a park or somewhere near a wooden area. Then the rest of the show takes place in the cheapest FAKEST office building, with very obvious fake walls, fake windows, fake doors, fake lights. ,Save for the protagonists, no one seems to work in the office !! All they do is walk in the background, over and over again at the same pace for no reason at all. Not one bit is believable. Now the night scenes : the same stupid street is used for ALL the episodes. For a show that takes place in DC, they could have at least have SOME scenes in DC, right? Nope.,Conclusion : unrealistic, unbelievable writing, terrible corny jokes, unlikeable characters, can't believe they made 12 seasons of this",NCIS,3
After all something new about zombies,"So I was not wanting to watch this because of the ""zombie"" thing because I was over it. But it kind of surprised me. I am looking to see more of it. Its not just about zombies. It has some comedy and some thrill too in it. Moreover there was a lack of women heroes so I think it will fill that. And also the girl is the cutest zombie I have ever seen. Moreover there no long intro that makes it easy to go with. Just hope they don't bring a hole family of zombies now. Also one would love how this zombie is stylish too kind of wears good clothes. So this can be a new add on for series liking people. I think it will be a good one.",iZombie,9
"Watchable, Not Award Winning","There are several things that save this series from a meh rating. Rose McIver is likable. I don't know who she is, but she apparently has a fan club that heavily backs the show. She's likable on screen, and can put a little bit of extra life into an otherwise mediocre setting. The zombie angle is clearly there because the original premise or written material was mediocre on its own. OK, I don't know that it was added after, but it definitely has that ""put a little herbs & spice into a meal to stop it from tasting bland"" kind of feel.,Apparently, this series is made by the creators of Veronica Mars (I don't know this until went to write this review – btw I also have a VM review here). Well, it's no VM version2 (despite fanboys claiming otherwise). This series is somebody attempting to play it a little safe, like a cricketer hitting a single instead of hitting a boundary, or a baseballer hitting to left field to get to first base. It does succeed here, but possibly only because of McIver's likability.,They could have done more with McIver's zombiism, such as maybe make it more of a struggle not to eat a living person or something. Zombiism here is no more serious than being a vegetarian. But this is the work of creators seeking to keep things at the shallow end of the pool (without going into the children's section); perhaps too timid for another VM, or maybe incapable of reproducing their premier work. ,At the end of season 2, I thought they were about to decimate all watchability from the show in season 3, but so far they've managed not to explode their internal organs onto the floor. We'll see how long they can continue with this safe, almost camp, but watchable series, but for now it's still worthy of viewing pleasure, as long as you're not expecting award winning writing from it.,Btw: It's really worth 6.5 to 6.8, but I'm not going to bump it up to 7 (because that's VM's rating - why VM only has a 7 is explained in that review).",iZombie,6
how stuff like this gets 8/10,"A lot of pretty mediocre series are getting 8+ reviews. This a 6 at best. I watched 2 episodes, even though the trailer picture of this should have warned me: A Christina Ricci type beautiful zombie (should there ever be such thing as a beautiful zombie????) with a tongue in cheek look on her face and a plate of noodles covered with some brains. It just screams teenie bopper crap... Why people can not see series for what they are, even if they like them? For instance, personally I enjoyed Crossbones with John Malkovitch a lot. If you'd ask me to rate it, I'd give it a 6.1. Why? because even though I love the genre and love to see JM in action, that's all this series is worth. Not everything you like has to be an 8 or 9. Are these all real figures or is the industry meddling with these results?? Terrible... IMDb used to be some kind of standard, now it has gone Rotten Tomatoes....",iZombie,1
Hell yeah!,"In a world.. where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty, #Deadpool comes along and shows you how it's done! It's the perfect combo of action, comedy, and R-rating that really don't give two sh*ts about your sensitivity. Do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl you've been crushing on during chemistry class in high school? Well, you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for DEADPOOL.,Ryan Reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, Morena Baccarin plays his hot-ass girlfriend, Vanessa. This woman is the embodiment of sexy. They are a match made in Marvel Comics' heaven. But their dream is crushed upon discovering that Wilson has cancer all over, a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers. The lab is run by Francis/Ajax (Ed Skrein) who himself is a bit of a mutant. The brutal experiments turn Wade Wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one. He's now bent on revenge, especially after Ajax kidnaps Vanessa. Meanwhile Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead from the X-Men, try their best to convince Deadpool to join their team and become one of the good guys. But let's face it, that ain't DEADPOOL's style! The first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writers/creators Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other. The next people in line to thank are screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who remind us why we loved ""Zombieland"" back in 2009, they inject the same brand of humor into DEADPOOL and keep the character faithful to the comic books, yes, by that I mean none of that crap version of Wade Wilson in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" anymore! Applause goes to Tim Miller as well, what a helluva feature directorial debut, clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out, if you just let him run with it, it's like giving G.I. Joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart, great things can happen.,For those of you who are not familiar with DEADPOOL, just a heads up, this movie, just like the comics, is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex, violence and humor, and that's exactly how we like it. Wade Wilson is a chatterbox, he talks a lot, to some this can get annoying, while to the rest, it's music to our ears, mainly because of the sh*t he says. And he breaks fourth wall, meaning he'll talk to you the audience. But what's even more epic than that is the fact that he is AWARE of the universe that he's in and the universe that you're in, and those two collide in the most epic way possible, so Ryan Reynolds' character, Wade Wilson, makes fun of Ryan Reynolds the actor and also mocks Ryan Reynolds' previous poor decisions like Green Lantern and People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive This movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans, it even has what I think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema. For a while, I heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants, but I'm glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment a.k.a origin story, so it's simple enough for the new fans to follow. I love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic, it's like insult comedy or one of them roast shows, everybody is fair game. The fights are rock 'em sock 'em and the VFX is impressive! And I can't be happier for Ryan Reynolds, I'm sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since ""Green Lantern"" and whatever the hell that was in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" so with this DEADPOOL movie, he finally got it right, you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre, and so now he's really part of the gang. He was born for this role. He was destined to play this. In many ways, Deadpool is kinda like Van Wilder on crack. And actress Morena Baccarin as Vanessa well, let's just say that after watching this movie, every guy on earth will wonder, 'Why can't my girlfriend be more like that!' If you're looking for a date movie, DEADPOOL is it. if you're looking for an action-packed movie, DEADPOOL is definitely most certainly it.",Deadpool,10
Worst Marvel Movie Ever,"Out of all Marvel movies made, Deadpool was the worst. The main character talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes. The jokes were not funny. The scene transition between flashbacks and present conditions were not well done.,They tried to put in 2 X-Men character in the worst possible way. It really shows that the studio had no budget for many characters, but instead they invested a lot in the slow-motion special effect, which was cool.,In terms of story-line, there's no story. There's no character building as well. For about 2 hours, all you can do is endure the horrible blabber mouth of the main character. Not funny and irritate the ear.,I wonder how many people did the studio pay to write in good reviews in this website...,Worst Marvel Movie Ever.",Deadpool,1
Best comedy on television,"The track record of cop comedies on television is not inspiring. While successful police dramas have ruled the airwaves for decades, the same cannot be said for cop shows that aim for laughs. There are some noticeable exceptions such as ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" and the very short-lived ""Police Squad"", but for the most part, it has been hard for show-runners to make crime a funny topic on TV. ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" could have ended up being super broad like ""Police Academy: The Series"" or ""Reno 911"", but luckily creators Dan Goor and Michael Schur have made the decision to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality, allowing for viewers to relate to the characters without them becoming complete cartoons. In casting Andy Samberg as the lead, there was the risk of ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" coming across too goofy. However, Samberg is at his career best here as Jake Peralta, a childish and immature detective who just happens to be very good at his profession. Samberg is great at delivering the most ridiculous and silly lines of dialogue without mugging for the camera in the way that some might expect a former ""Saturday Night Live"" performer to do. Half of what Peralta says is either completely juvenile or inappropriate, but because it never reaches cartoonish or mean-spirited heights, he remains likable and easy-to-root-for. The show may eventually reach a point where it may seem absurd that the character is able to keep his job, though that hasn't occurred yet.,If ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" had just been a vehicle for Samberg, the show might have become stale after a few episodes. Wisely, the decision was made to make an ensemble series. It's typical for an ensemble to have one or two characters that aren't quite as funny or interesting as the others, but amazingly, every single character on ""Brooklyn-Nine Nine"" is excellently performed. Andre Braugher, Chelsea Peretti, Joe Lo Truglio, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, and Terry Crews are all perfectly cast in their respective roles and each have moments where they shine in every single episode. Crews is absolutely hilarious as squad leader Terry Jeffords, especially when the writers are able to make great use out of both his physical strength and priceless facial reactions. In addition to the main ensemble cast, the reoccurring duo of Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller as Detectives Hitchcock and Scully, the two worst detectives in the department, are responsible for some of the best jokes of the series thus far. It's also worth noting the writers have made nice use of its guest stars including Craig Robinson, Andy Richter, Stacy Keach, and Dean Winters. Guest stars on sitcoms can be tricky and can often overshadow the episodes as a whole, but ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" almost always makes its guest stars fit organically into the plot in ways that never feel gimmicky or forced.,Although there have only been a dozen episodes so far and there is always the chance that the broadness the show-runners have been so good at keeping down may eventually kick in, the series now remains as strong and frequently hilarious as any comedy on television at the moment. There isn't a particular formula that the show gets hung up on every week and more often than not, there seems to be an effort to get in a decent amount of character development by sitcom standards. If Fox is smart enough to keep ""Brooklyn-Nine Nine"" on for a while, it will almost certainly develop a cult following. If the ratings don't improve and only one season gets produced, at least the series will probably hold the distinction of not having a bad episode in the bunch. 9/10",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
Shows a lot of promise - a very likable new sitcom.,"I'm confused by the reviewer (whose comment was featured on the IMDb page just now) who seemingly despised this program and wrote it off, apparently, because he or she felt Andre Braugher deserved better.,I find this review odd, because ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" - if nothing else - comes across as a very likable show. ,Thankfully spared of talking-head interview segments that have dominated the American comedy scene since The Office, this show also thankfully features no laugh track. Thus, it both has the feel of an old-fashioned sitcom without the dated quality of one. It's actually quite a clever premise: it's a ""cop show"" but set in the workplace environment. This is a clever move as the show is able to subvert some of the stereotypical police procedural elements while also keeping stuff grounded and relatable by keeping the majority of the antics constrained to the police station.,The cast is talented all across the board. One thing you might find as the show grows is that Andy Samberg will become more subdued in his approach. I say this because as of now he is clearly the ""star"" of the show and, as such, he's often given a lot of LOUD dialogue -- but this also happened to the Leslie Knope character in ""Parks and Recreation,"" and she ended up organically evolving into a much smarter and more likable character. I think once Brooklyn Nine-Nine finds its own footing and more firmly establishes its characters, things will settle into place. It's still a bit shaky but it's just the freshman season flaws. Very few comedy shows are at their best in their first seasons.,I'm enjoying this quite a lot so far - it's not must-see-TV or anything of the sort, but it's likable, entertaining and shows a lot of promise. The talented cast really elevates the material and the show manages to subvert cop show clichés and workplace TV comedy tropes without seeming overly cynical or snide about it. That's really the best word I can think of summing it up with: likable.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,8
Abby makes the show,"The character Abby is great and funny...  She makes the whole show as far as I am concerned.  I just wish she was more of a main character and they had her onscreen more...  This is the first show where a Goth type character is shown as something more than some wierdo to be avoided.  I wish more shows would do the same.  The rest of the cast is ok...and the show has its moments.  Not quite as intense as the other CIS shows but maybe that's why I like it.  While the other shows seem so serious, NCIS adds humor (especially as mentioned above with the Goth Abby) which makes it great.  David McCallum is an excellant actor and helps to make the show with his ""Semi-absent minded professor"" style where he seems to get off on tangents while explaining things.  I hope they keep this show on the air...it is one of my favorites.",NCIS,
Disappointing,"(cue The Cranberries song ""Disappointment) The first episode I saw of NCIS was the one where the great (now late) Charles Durning played the Medal of Honor recipient, and I thought, ""wow, this is really good."" So my wife picked up the first 3 season on DVD at a garage sale (FIRST WARNING!) so I sat down to watch.,Wait a minute, I thought, this isn't NCIS, the thoughtful touching program I watched a few weeks ago. It was more like 90210 or ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" with the juvenile characters than a professional organization like SVU or CSI like I was used to watching. ,I'm not getting into details; this show is now 11 years old and well known. What I am amazed at is how people on the board go on and on about the same negative things that I picked up on as early as the first season and were glaring by the end of the third. I suppose they keep on with the series for the same reason you go on with a wife or husband you've been married to for 20 years: You remember when it was good and pray that somehow life (the show) will get back to that.,One thing more. I really wanted to like this show, really. I like cop shows, I like tight teams and good stories. IMO this is nothing more than a cop-based soap opera featuring the saga of Mossadu Barbie and Jethro Bodine... I mean Gibbs. I come back every now and again hoping it's better, but it's been a waste of my time. 6*** for the cast, 1* for everything else about it.",NCIS,2
"This is not CSI at all. This is, one of the best approaches and invasions to the life of an investigator","Today, the TV is fulled with stuff, you can find almost everything. And if crime is what you 're looking for, CSI Miami or CSI NY are the average answers. Why? Very easy: American government, then American people, then American nation wants to see themselves like Superman all the time. That's why we see Gary Sinsie breaking a terrorist, David Carusso putting his sunglasses and shaking the hand of his Mexican friend, who in the next episode, he may kill, after doing what they call ""justice"" OK, ladies and germs: for those that think that crime and justice are so easy words, I'm sorry to tell you: You're wrong. Crime is not that easy. And, as I said before, the TV is fulled. So, we also have the ""true crime"" shows like Criminal Minds, Law And Order CI and SVU, Withouth a Trace and many more. In Law And Order CI, they usually focus on the victims, with very strong and dense cases, but someone wonders: ""What about the investigator itself? Does it have to be danger danger all the time or can you have some fun?"" If that is your question, NCIS is one of your main answers. NCIS comes from Donald P. Bellisario, the creator of the well-known series JAG. He was also a writer of several Magnum P.1 episodes. NCIS is, more than just forensics, it's a character show. It's the story of the in and out relationships of the investigators and scientists of an agency that does anything criminal tied up to the marines, thing that Bellisario liked to do also in JAG. Therefore, we can find humor, drama, love, tragedy, and some bits of US action, besides of one of the most unusual characters you can find on such genre: an 50's former marine is the leader, a goth forensics and an 86 years old Scotish M.E that talks to his corpses. If we do a season analysis on the show, we can conclude that, it has been rising to good. The first season was a bit of CSI style, everyone was just cool. But it already had the trademark humor and a good ending. Season 2 could have initially been the same case, but the end was totally surprising. Season 3 was a very ruff one, were mistakes and chance are all the time, 4 was just human, and 5... Well, 5 has not shown up yet down here at Mexico, but I have heard that is good.

Very entertaining...,"This show combines humor, mystery, horror, and sci-fi all in one. The plot is complex but easily understandable, especially if you like a good conspiracy theory. The characters are interesting and reflect real people (i.e., they are multi-dimensional). Despite the subject matter the language is very mild and I appreciate that. Each episode has its own story but also moves forward the larger, underlying plot. This is a new take on the Zombie we've all come to fear. I enjoy watching this show to unwind before bed. I'm waiting for another season!!!",iZombie,10
Great series!,"I did not think I was going to like this at all. I put off watching this show for months. I can say now, that I wish I didn't. I had thought it would be ridiculous, boring, and all over the place. I was so wrong! This series is wonderful! Great, non-ridiculous humour, delightful concept. It adds to the table of zombies, bringing forth new ideas that can make sense, while still having some of the old clichés, like: 'zombies love brains'. The actors are absolutely flawless when it comes to their jobs. I highly recommend that you watch a full episode or two before deciding what you think of it. As I said, I strongly thought I would hate it and ended up loving it!",iZombie,10
2016 begins with the most pathetic movie ever !,"Barney the Dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie. yeah sure, when he cracks one or two jokes, its funny, but my gosh he would go on and on ! ,Regarding the sexual scenes of the movie, if one wants to watch porn, they'd watch porn. I don't know which woman enjoys a man that talks from beginning to end ? Even during sex he is cracking lame jokes. Cant get any more ridiculous than that ! ,As for the storyline , couldn't they add a little more detail. Its like they thought making him blabber throughout the movie will allow them to cut some finer details out. ,One of the worst movies ever made in the last century !",Deadpool,1
A simple summary (without the spoilers); what you need to know,"We live in a time where super hero movies are all the rage. Who doesn't love a good super hero throw down, cool origin stories, and awesome villains? While decent hero flicks are easy enough to find, occasionally a masterpiece, like ""The Dark Knight"", will come along and in the process wow the critics and audiences alike.,And then we get Deadpool. Where to start with this one? To give it some comparison, it makes ""Batman and Robin"" look like an Academy Award-winner by comparison. How is that? Quite simply put, the movie is terrible in every sense of the word.,Deadpool is untrue to its source material and to the very character himself. The character is known for his violence and humor throughout his comic book, TV show, and video game appearances. The filmmakers, in their apparent efforts to make the character more ""edgy"" and appeal more to adults, have stripped him of this, instead replacing the comedy and fun with crude dialogue, sex, sex, more sex, and more foul words than possibly all of Eminem and Lil Wayne's albums combined, and all of this without any of the substance that have made Wade Wilson's adventures and misadventures alike over the years so memorable, exciting, and laugh-out-loud funny. ,No wit, and no soul. It insults the intelligence of its audience, and then expects them to pay. We've come a long way in terms of the quality of super hero films; to call this a step back could potentially be the biggest understatement of the year.,For those who have been waiting for a good Deadpool film, this unfortunately is not it. Perhaps the best on-screen appearance to- date can be found in the animated short ""Hulk v.s. Wolverine"", but for the time being we're still going to have to wait for our favorite ""Merc with the Mouth"" to get the big-screen sensation that he deserves.",Deadpool,1
Cop Shows: Prepare to be Mocked!,"Equal parts Mockumentary-style Comedy + Cop Show = A perfect parody of detective shows. The star detective (played by Samberg) winningly carries the lead with charm (if not grace), but as part of a true ensemble cast, carefully crafted iconic roles played well, and all won me over in the first episode. The surprisingly gay new police chief is a riot for how he takes his zany team in stride, breaking character to enjoy their antics, while maintaining a strict iron-faced facade. Rosa, in particular, stands out as 'scary cop' - Stephanie Beatriz will be a breakout star with this role - you can't get enough of her...and if she and Clumsy Mousy Charles get together or even just continue to dance around it, they'll be the best, most hilarious parody of a Will They/Won't They ever! ,The producers claim to be channeling Barney Miller - a far-fetched chutzpadik claim for people who did NOT produce THAT 70s Show, because rarely have current television producers captured that classic 70s overt brand of comedy, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has indeed! There's a bit of a Naked Gun feel to it as well, what with the vaguely idiotic running gags and horseplay, but Jake Peralta is sharper (and more competitive) than Frank Drebin - leaving Charles to play the fool for him. When Peralta solves crime, it's not accidental - but neither can you take it very seriously, as even the arrest is more of an SNL skit than a semblance of a cop show arrest. I watched the pilot more out of curiosity (and Samberg fan-girl-ing) then out of any hope I would add this to my roster, but wonder of wonders, this thing actually works! Creative and original ""detective"" comedy - I'll be watching.,I'd recommend this to BOTH people who can't stand cop/detective shows and just want to look down their nose whilst laughing at them, AND to people who love cop/detective shows, so they can learn just how stereotypical, cliché and canned their favorites are.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,9
Love Samberg & Braugher!,"Who would think of this duo would be the best part of the series. Saturday Night Live's Adam Samberg plays Jake Peralta, a cop in Brooklyn, New York. The precinct gets a new captain played by Emmy winner and Homicide: Life on the Streets actor Andre Braugher who plays the straight man to Samberg's Peralta. Braugher is great in his role and one the reasons to watch and the other is Andy Samberg. I hope this show lasts the season. It isn't filmed in front of a live audience. It's more like other sitcoms today where they film in a studio and on location. It's good to have a sitcom in New York City than another crime drama. Audiences need to laugh more these days.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,8
Interesting but Cheap,"Okay I'll make it short : this show has good potential, could have been a major TV Success, but as it starts with the main theme, you immediately know what's up....some cheap synthetic piano track, with no mood and no spirit, that compared to this even Charlie Harper's jingles sound better...! PLUS, how the hell can you be as arrogant as the Gibbs character..?! I mean, who the hell does he think he is, some kinda God or something ? by hitting his employees behind the head and directing orders the way he does...The guy pisses off after 10minutes of watching, THIS IS NOT FUNNY ! I wouldn't even show this series to my kid, being afraid he'd have a wrong opinion of respect and human behavior...",NCIS,2
Is this the end?,"This show has survived the coming and going of many cast members over the years, but the latest changes -- Michael Weatherly out, Jennifer Esposito and Wilmer Valderrama in -- doesn't look promising. ,The total ridiculousness of the stories and the absurd ""science"" have always been big negatives, but the interplay of the characters made it watchable in spite of the problems.,Even without Weatherly, they are trying to fit his father (Robert Wagner) into the story line and it just seems silly.,Maybe the chemistry will improve as the season progresses, but so far (9 episodes into season 15) it just isn't working for me.",NCIS,6
Not Happy with this season's cast changes!,"I am very disappointed with this season's cast changes. I have been a loyal fan of NCIS from the very beginning. I've always enjoyed the show and thought the writing was great and the characters were believable. But Jennifer Esposito has all but ruined the show for me. I find her to be rude, arrogant, obtrusive and obnoxious. She definitely Does Not fit in with the team! Wilmer Valderrama may eventually fit in, once he learns that he is there to work, not to flirt with every skirt on the show and search for apartments while he is supposed to be working a crime scene! Also, the writing has taken a decided turn for the worse - the character's parts are all over the place, and it seems they have no idea what they are doing with Jimmy Palmer this season. The show used to be balanced, told a good story, and treated all of the characters well. Now it seems they have lost their way caring more about jumping on the politically correct, diversity, and inclusive bandwagon than with creating the award winning show they have had for all these years. Very sad to see such a great show fall apart like this :-(",NCIS,5
The time you waste watching is nothing to the time wasted producing this,"Look, I get that there are some people out there who would upvote anything they like 10/10, regardless of quality or depth. The problem is, when you're dealing with something that only people like that would watch, you get mediocre, redundant series (and films) with 8+ ratings. I don't think it's wrong, but it's kind of boring. If that's what it takes to justify institutional art criticism... The series itself is boring in the extreme. The setting is formulaic - teenage comedy based on a flimsy premise: a young, good-looking girl becomes a zombie, but, instead of becoming a complete outcast, learns to use her ""gift"" to good end. The problem? She has to eat human brains on the regular. The solution? Get a job at the coroner's office. The perks? She gets to see visions of how her ""clients"" died. These look like fantastic ingredients for a wacky comedy-horror. Except that they aren't. The lead character isn't only dealing with being a zombie - she's also heartbroken (dumped her fiancé because of her ""condition""), blissfully ignorant of the larger ramifications of her status (it's clear from the outset she CANNOT be the only one zombie out there), perfectly free from any turmoil caused by being a zombie (her social life only suffers because she sulks, her ""illness"" doesn't transmit in any way, and her hunger is easily satiated)... There's no real drama here, but there also can be no real pleasure in watching this unfold. The producers did all in their power to make the series attractive. Wanna zombie crime-solver? Got it. An attractive zombie? Yup. A popular neo-noir setting? Seattle, here we come! But they simply can't juggle both the comedy and the horror. The eventual mix is rich in unfunny jokes and unsurprising twists. The pilot might be the most depressing comedy script I've seen in months. It doesn't help that the lead is also the narrator - her blissful ignorance of anything beyond the immediate setting of the story transfers into the narration, making the viewer feel he's being dumbed out by the minute. The association with Veronica Mars is right on the money - this is all plastic, no story. I'm sure there's a sizeable audience for things like these (plastic goods are always popular, and sometimes even not that bad), but they clearly aren't worth 8+ in ratings - not even when the raters are all under 18. There doesn't even seem to be any rebellion involved in how the story is told: despite her ""special"" status, the lead mostly plays the dumb blonde to the smart (her superior) and the tough (her policeman-sidekick). It doesn't help that the smart is of an Asian ethnicity, and the tough is black. I can't think of one feature of this series that doesn't scream ""boring"" back at me...",iZombie,4
Bravo CW !,"The reason I am giving this a 10 is because it's so much fun, I actually started watching them late and binged watched the first five episodes where I realized the show is one heck of a ride, funny, a bit tragic and somehow charming and feel-good kinda show.,While the episodes and story lines build up, you'll realize it's a CSI-ish kinda show, only for the younger generation. ,SPOILER: The Villain storyline is great and it's the kind of storyline you'll be annoyed for not having it solved yet. I would wanna punch the heck out of the bad guys.,SPOILER: Every story contains a murder and Liv has #SpecialPowers after being turned into a zombie that will help her solve each and every murder, but that comes with a TWIST !!,The acting is surprisingly amazing, Rose McIver is great as Liv Moore and let's see what they have in store for the rest of the season and next season !!",iZombie,10
Just non stop jokes that mainly fall flat (NO Spoilers),"First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.,The movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially. I am fine with low brow humor when it is funny. The writers just seem to have Reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny. I think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes. There is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor. It is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumb.,The plot is nothing more than a simple background (origins) story and it is run of the mill. The movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative. The movie is very similar to Super and the Kick Ass movies. However, those movies were superior to Deadpool on every level IMO. The movie also reminds me of the Vacation remake. The 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funny.,This movie may just be better for younger audiences but I still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source material.,I give it a 2 out of 10. It gets an 2 instead of 1 only because Morena Baccarin was a side character. She did the best she could with the limited material.,Dean",Deadpool,2
Waste of Time and Money,"This movie is a huge disappointment, and a waste of money and time. The jokes are stupid and I realize that Deadpool is not what it was cracked up to be. Too bad as I usually love the Marvel movies. It seems forced, and the jokes actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level, more adolescent bathroom style humor. The story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes. At times I thought to walk out, but kept hoping that there would be a redeeming aspect as many of the reviews were positive, I kept hoping. This movie is more about money-making hype, with its non existent story/plot and childish humor with no depth. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.",Deadpool,1
Film should have a maximum age limit of 10,"The film is made out of Ryan Reynolds, throwing lame jokes to the camera. In between there are bullets and knifes. No surprises. No ideas. The story is simple and silly and boring. Man sleeps with woman long in different scenes (Teens hello! Better watch porn, there are more details!) Man go's to basement to become special. (Teens like to be special) Man becomes special and kills all bad guys around him. THE END,The jokes are not only lame, they are old. For example the joke with the red shirt and brown trousers I heard from my grandpa.,Don't waste your time with this film. Marvell tries to squeeze out last cents out of the theme. Bad films will follow.",Deadpool,1
Comfort-Food of Shows,"B99 is a rare gem among serial comedy duds. It's such a smart and fast-paced show that never fails to make me laugh, smile, and sometimes cry at very touching and human moments. This is a comfort show for me and I love rewatching for the running gags, callbacks to previous episodes, and to see the character development as they grow as people in ways that don't feel forced or contrived. ,The characters start out fairly rough and jagged with their own individual struggles but grow as a squad after the introduction of Capt. Holt. This is a feature, not a bug! The point of the show is that they're flawed! ,Do not listen to anyone who rates this lower than a seven, most of the people who do can't be bothered to spell names right (racist much?).",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
"Delightful show, No Laugh Tracks, Golden Content","Brooklyn Nine-Nine is definitely one of my favorite ever sitcom. It's a show of pure comedy with humorous stories that are naturally delivered by the lovely actors and actresses, but also with a consistent storyline which a lot of sitcoms lack. The other thing I've noticed which makes this show better is the exclusion of laugh tracks. Although, laugh tracks do, to a certain extent, seem to make shows more hilarious and to a point where even if you don't understand a joke, you'd laugh. But no, this show has no cheats like that and amuses viewers with original content.
The show also does not rely on one-liners or simple jokes, and instead, make use of the characters' personalities and actions to entertain viewers, which is pretty smart. Some might think that entertainment with personalities do not last as they stay the same and eventually people would get tired of them. However, with the ongoing characters development, their personalities and stories are often changing, which makes the show so fresh all the time.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,9
This show is better than it should be,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a show about a police precinct in Brooklyn and it follows a variety of characters, who are a bunch of misfits who when they get to work they do a really good job, there are weirdos, nerds, and one of the most egotistical characters you will ever likely see. Despite this all of the characters are amazing as they are all likable and have incredible chemistry which makes this show one you should watch.,It mainly follows Jake Peralta who is a guy who loves his work, is incredibly immature and usually takes inspiration from action films like Die Hard whilst on a case. The show always follows the other characters in engaging and hilarious plot lines which also shows off different traits and experiences of their separate characters. ,Whilst it is an amazing show, it has it's flaws such as every finale has started to end in mostly the same way and the first couple of episodes of the next series will be centred around this one thing. As with any show there are some episodes that are not as good as the others, however after 4 seasons there are no seriously bad episodes so that is great.,One last issue is that there is a duo in the precinct called Hitchcock and Scully who exist solely to be gross out characters (Which I don't particularly mind) and are essentially the exact same character, however they can be really funny and they do have characteristics even though they have the least amount of character development than anyone else in the show. ,So in conclusion this is an exceptional show which has a wide range of lovable characters and many different kinds of humour and jokes which are usually very funny. If you have seen a trailer for this show and it expect it to be another of those sitcom comedies like, New girl and The Big Bang Theory, it actually has a much higher level of quality then those two. (Personally I really like TBBT even though it got noticeably worse after a couple of seasons and NG I never really liked even though I watched all of the first season),So I seriously recommend this show and would say at least give one or two episodes a watch.,Have a good one. :)",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,9
Something For Everyone,"Being a big Dark Angel fan (at least a Season One Dark Angel fan), my main reason for watching NCIS originally was Michael Weatherly. Seeing how he could play someone so different from Logan Cale was fascinating for me. That fact that Mark Harmon (whom I've always enjoyed watching)and David McCallum (fan of the Shaphire and Steel program)were also in the program was a bonus. My sister in law is a Mark Harmon fan, so she got something out of the program and everybody (my father included) loves Abby. This is a program that everyone in the family can get something out of. The occasional Dark Angel reference thrown in adds to my fun. (i.e William Gregory Lee who played Zack in Dark Angel was a guest star and was the actor who played Logan's Uncle Jonas)",NCIS,9
unreal,"First off, I have to agree with a minority of other reviewers who describe the show's characters as stereotypical and irritating. Secondly, NCIS are detectives, who investigate crimes usually taking place on Navy jurisdiction, or sometimes involving high-profile Naval personnel. They are not a combination of the FBI or the CIA. They do not conduct counter-terrorism operations or any overseas covert ops. They do not run off to the hills of W. Virginia to find out why a Marine on leave fell of a cliff. They do not work out of a headquarters with an electronics array and lab resembling something out of a sci-fi set. They do not drive at break-neck speed without being stopped by local police. They are not at odds with all other law enforcement agencies, and are definitely not superior to any of them. It is not considered inferior duty to be assigned to a regional office or aboard a ship. In short, NCIS is an agency of competent investigators who perform their jobs with the same resources as most other agencies. They are portrayed on TV with a lot of artistic license.",NCIS,4
Postmodernism manifested via zombie...,"Rob Thomas does a great job describing the entire postmodern experience via Rose's character. Rose delivers concise and incisive monologues that express the postmodern dilemma of our children. Rose's witty thoughts are frequently paraphrases of famous literary works that create a comfortable, yet thought provoking experience. Perfectionism, over-achiever, nihilist, and a search for meaning in a multi-polar world that makes little sense and contains almost no substance. ,Addendum...

Rating and reviews are false. Movie was terrible.,"I wish I could give rating in minus, like minus 5 . I don't know why people think it's a great movie. if this movie is rated 8.6 or 8.7 it must be out of 100. I would rather sit at home and watch Hancock twice than watching Deadpool. Movie is nothing more but parody of X-Men movie. There is NO story-line. I felt so dumb to go watch this movie in theater. They tried to put some adult comedy but its not worth spending time and money for it. It was not a love story from any angle nor it was funny. Ryan Reynolds sucks - just like he did in green lantern and any other movie. Apart from few adult jokes, all I saw/heard was his BLABBER in front of camera.",Deadpool,1
I love this series so much if you haven't hated already binge it now!,Brooklyn nine nine required a few episodes for me to really get into it but when I did I couldn't stop watching it. this American sitcom is based in a police station. Each episode is completely unique and stays at a consistent level of quality for all 4 seasons that I have enjoyed. As I got into the thickness of the series I got to know each and every hilarious character and by season 3 I loved every well acted character. I may be a little biased but whether or not I know your gonna love it so watch it now. As a note I will say that like me your going to have to watch a few episodes to get into it.,Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
Not the best show but certainly worth checking out and supporting,"This is my first review on IMDb ever and I'm not reviewing this show because I think it's the best show in the world (How I Met Your Mother will always hold that place in my heart) but because I think it's the best new show of this season and it's really funny (not perfect, but really funny) and I'm afraid that as the ratings for this show continue to drop it's going to get canceled. But that would be a big mistake because it's a very funny show with lots of potential and a great cast. Also, it has Andy Samberg in it which is kind of a guarantee for me. So give the show a chance and tune in so probably the only good new sitcom this year doesn't get canceled like everyone expects!",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
every element is entertainment,"There is simply nothing about NCIS that is not to like. I'll get the superficial stuff out of the way first - every camera angle on Michael Weatherly is gorgeous, and he plays it so well as Anthony DiNozzo. Ziva, his partner, is most adorable with every cultural nuance she utters as she tries to grasp American idioms. It's charming and realistic. Her ability to speak Israeli for some plot lines truly adds to her beauty and character-balancing the serious with the humorous sides of the show. Bringing David McCallum into our lives again brings the emotion of nostalgia. How we loved his British accent in THE MAN FOR U.N.C.L.E. His charming ramblings, his sensitivity to forensics, and his educational lessons are perfect. Characters McGee and Abby play perfectly off each other. and Mark Harmon is the guiding treasure. Tie up in a bow, and they have all played their characters so convincingly that we are invited to be part of their team every week. That's true TV. The bonus: no foul language, machine guns blaring, and no sex (but plenty of engaging innuendos). Please tune in. This show is such a delight.",NCIS,10
"Childish, immature, stupid jokes","The level of content is for the first graders, except peppered with obscenities and curse words all over, this is what makes it rated R.

I can't rely on average rating as a measure of movie quality anymore. Seriously, this is the worst experience in a long long time.

I'm not saying there should not be sex in movies, but this just makes the whole thing a farse. it was awful, no wonder it has a 16 rating.

It was a failed xmen movie or a paridy on the xmen? if they want to show playboy in the cinema they should just say so and I would avoid it.

"Was great, until Season 5",It just became waaay too liberal. I used to love the show because it was meant for laughs and was seriously funny.

Not horrible yet not all that good either.,"I watched the first five episodes of this new comedy, mostly because it received a Golden Globe for best TV comedy series.,I spoke to a few friends that have watched this series and they said the comedy seemed somewhat like a flat The Office, Parks and Recreation or even Office Space. After watching a few episodes it felt as if that's the type of audience they were shooting for yet seemed to miss. The Office, while being fairly low-brow and borderline slap- stick, at least was able to deliver jokes and circumstances that were believable yet absurd at the same time and many can relate to this if you've ever been in a cubicle style office job for any extended period of time.,Brooklyn Nine-Nine, to me, missed that gray area between the totally absurd and a documentary of a police station. Instead of riding that fine line, which makes a comedy work, they went too far off into absurdity land and anything there to anchor them back to reality is too far removed that this eventually begins to feel like a show full of absurd police-precinct jokes and 60 second skits mashed together to form a thoroughly blended plot. To top all of it off, the absurdities in these skits are executed by equally absurd character personalities.,I actually like some of the actors in this show like Terry Crews, Andre Braugher and to a lesser extent Andy Samberg and I think with some re- tooling of the writing it could really work. ,I'm honestly confused as how the judges for the Golden Globe could pick this as the best comedy TV series. Maybe I'll check it out if it lasts through another season.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,3
This show is so TERRIBLE,"I know I can't be the only person out there that sees through this show's god-awful cheesiness! For crying out loud every character is completely unoriginal cop cliché: an old bitter chauvinist leader, an asshat trigger-happy tough guy, a noobish rookie, a jaded female cop always trying to show that she's man enough for the job, and nerdy techie that knows everything, yet manages to remain 'cool' at the same time. Every episode begins with Gibbs saying ""We've got a dead Marine!"" and ends with the team stopping Al-Quada's latest plot to blow up Washington DC. ,If you can get around the obnoxious character and episode clichés then there is still the element of realism: real NCIS agents don't hunt terrorists in (US) city streets. At least 97% of the events that happens in this show are things they would never be involved in at all in real life.,But who am I kidding, mindless patriotic action shows are the hot thing these days, and people eat it up like hungry pigs.",NCIS,3

These jokes are true to Deadpool, but that's it. They are the jokes Deadpool would crack, but most of the time they missed the mark and were not even remotely funny.,There's absolutely no story in the movie, none at all.

On top of that, for some reason Ajax kidnaps Pool's girlfriend and sets target on his back. ,It makes no sense.,Apart from jokes, Deadpool also has inner voice, but not in this movie.

His inane behavior was disgusting and his putting others in jeopardy by stopping to say stupid joke lines right in the middle of apprehending a suspect was less police-like than anything the Three Stooges ever did when they portrayed cops.,I couldn't understand the female detective who happily agreed to see a movie with a colleague, then after challenging him to pick something good, suddenly canceled—right after he bought tickets. Before I could figure that out, she appeared to have changed her mind again.,The bet about who makes the most arrests between the two detectives was also stupid—anyone can make a lot of arrests. It would only make sense if they were betting on who got the most convictions.,When Jake got up at the meeting near the beginning and proceeded to waste everyone's time by talking about trivia regarding old people while he was supposed to be giving a run down on a recent crime, I thought we had tumbled to the bottom of the hill, but alas, it just continued sliding down, leaving me wondering how anyone gets any laughs from this tripe.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,2

The police are 2 dimensional and there is nothing close to any subtlety or humour.,I think it may appeal to some children of around 12 but certainly my children at that age would have described it as 'stupid' and refused to watch it.,children younger than 12 probably wouldn't understand a lot of the references in it so I'm not sure what audience it is aimed at.,blazing saddles it isn't.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,2
It's nothing more than a Police Academy wannabe,"Maybe this show would be better if they dumped Adam Sandberg. He is just over the top not funny. His stupid childish antics make me roll my eyes. His attempt at forced comedy is painful. The rest of the cast is also fairly weak, but let's try with dumping Sandberg and his completely unfunny antics first. I was really looking forward to this show when I first saw the previews. Not unlike a movie trailer, the TV spots show all of the funny parts out of context. When you see those same lines in context, they become very unfunny. That is an amazing feat. I watched the first episode and was just floored that I didn't laugh once. I gave it a second chance, and again, failed to even crack a smile. Looking back at those episodes, my dislike for the show centers around Sandberg.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1
bullshit ever seen,"i expected an epic out of this but i rather got boring and juvenile story.,This movie is full of unparliamentary dialougues and nothing inspiring about.,Is this what we give to our friends and family to watch ? btw ryan renolds did excellent job in the movie.,i didn't get why wolverine was in the movie,is he there to get kicked by deadpool,The film's biggest weakness, if it has one, is in its supporting characters — there's just not a lot for them to do. Deadpool's fellow superpowered beings — Colossus (Stefan Kapicic), Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), and Angel Dust (Gina Carano) — mostly just stay out of his way, though Colossus and Negasonic each have their moments. T.J. Miller is effective as Deadpool/Wade Wilson's BFF Weasel, but he feels like he was just ported over from HBO's Silicon Valley, where he plays a startup bro. Ajax, the movie's main villain, is sinister (and good-looking), but his mutant ability — not being able to feel pain — doesn't make him feel like much of a threat.",Deadpool,1
"Purile, camp, adolescent. An insult to the genre.","Truly awful rendition of a Marvel superhero. Turgid, adolescent and inane, routine CGI effects and a plot you could write on the back of a postage stamp. The so-called comedy lines are expelled as if from a failing gattling gun, interspersed with fantasy fillers including masturbation, soft toys and sex in Christmas sweaters. If this is you're thing - I suppose, go for it. Everyone else stay well clear. ,Had this been counter-balanced in any way by a genuine malevolence from our ""hero"" there may have been some redemption, but the violence is all just meaningless, cartoonish and blah.,Incredible that the back story involves Deadpool's attempt to ""win back the girl"" when he, and everything else in this waste of money movie is so overwhelmingly camp. Right up to the end credits when our hero, as a cartoon, jerks off a unicorn's horn to produce an ejaculate made of rainbows and fairy-dust. Truly, this is the very stuff this risible movie is made from.",Deadpool,1
Just not good,"I really tried to like this show. I found the pilot to be inane and not very funny but still kept watching episodes until I just couldn't take it anymore. Samberg plays Peralta. He is NOT funny in this role. His character is just a five year old in an adults body. The jokes are stupid, juvenile, and just terrible. The acting is really poor but I attribute that to the writing because I have seen a couple of the actors in other roles or on stage as a stand up (Peritti) and they were a lot better than the character's they have in this dumb series. Personally I don't see this debacle going even one season unless it is only scheduled to run for 5-10 episodes. Man do I hope so any way because then maybe something good will replace it.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1
Police Academy Step Aside,"Comedy is a difficult thing to pull off, especially if you have to do it for around seventy episodes, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine does this to a tee. It's hilarious without fault, entertaining to the max and watchable, so watchable, binge watchable. The characters are all likable and relatable, which many shows fail to do without making one main character annoying or dislikable. It's also very much original, without being original if you know what I mean. It spoofs all cop shows, but does it in a way that the overall project feels fresh and like something you've never seen before. ,Brooklyn Nine-Nine is fantastic, a true gem for the silver screen. It faults only in the fact that it will almost kill you, and that is due to the suffocation when you can't breathe due to laughter. If you are a fan of comedy watch this. If you are a fan of cop films watch this. If you are a human being watch this!",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
one of the stupidest shows i have ever seen,"I tried watching this with a couple of friends they said its really funny. I did not laugh once the humor is either childish or just dry and unoriginal. It is terrible writing terrible filming terrible acting this show is literally awful. I don't get how people find it funny, it doesn't have one single redeeming quality I will be very surprised if it Lasts much longer its the kind of show that is laughable in a very bad way. Just take this dry stupid excuse for a sitcom of the air already I would rather watch Disney channel then this garbage. Its ashame as well because there's a couple of actors I've liked on other things but they do not deliver in any way on this show. Absolute stupidity enough said.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,1
Bloody Brilliant,"Brooklyn Nine-Nine ★★★★★,Plot | A group of NYPD detectives solve crimes and mess up. A lot. Review | It is no secret that I am not a comedy kind of gal. Little can make me laugh in this cold, cold world. However, this show is probably the best television series I am watching at the moment. The writers of Parks and Rec have brought us a sarcastic documentary style sitcom set in the 99th precinct of Brooklyn, New York. The writers have struck a perfect balance of realism and farce making these characters funny but real. They take stereotypes of people and 180 them. The plot is immensely gripping and actually funny, the chemistry is insane. I cannot describe how much I have come to love the characters and feel for them when things didn't exactly go their way. I also love a bit of low-key feminism, because this show really wipes the floor when it comes to the sexist comedy that is so often used in 'Comedy Sit Coms' nowadays. This show is also packed with representation; there are so many different cultures that come into play. It also explores LGBTAQ+ and as I have mentioned before, feminism. This show is lead by a mostly female non-white cast, which for it's female and/or non-white watchers is incredibly refreshing. Seeing out stories on screen is a truly warm and fuzzy feeling!",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
Awesome show :D,"Brooklyn nine-nine is such an amazing show! Jake Peralta is such a good character; he's a feminist, his favorite artist is Taylor Swift and he's awesome. What's there not to love about him, seriously? Amy Santiago is super funny, too, and reminds me a lot about myself. The show also features a non-stereotypical LGBTQ character (Captain Ray Holt) and is super diverse overall. But it's also SO FUNNY! Mike Schur and Dan Goor are such good comedy writers (they both also wrote episodes for parks and recreation, so if you loved that you will love this). So please, guys, just do yourselves a favor and WATCH BROOKLYN NINE- NINE.",Brooklyn Nine-Nine,10
